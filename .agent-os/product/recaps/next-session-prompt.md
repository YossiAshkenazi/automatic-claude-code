# Next Session Actionable Prompt
## Complete Docker Validation & Real Dual-Agent Testing

### Primary Objective
Complete the dual-agent monitoring system validation by finishing Docker setup and conducting comprehensive testing with a real-world project scenario.

### Immediate Action Items (Priority Order)

#### 1. Complete Docker Monitoring Environment (HIGH PRIORITY)
**Current Status**: Docker containers are built and building process was initiated
**Action Required**:
```bash
# Check if Docker compose completed successfully
cd "C:\Users\Dev\automatic-claude-code"
docker-compose --profile monitoring ps
docker-compose --profile monitoring logs

# If successful, test the full monitoring environment
# Access monitoring dashboard at http://localhost:6011
# Verify API connectivity at http://localhost:4001
# Test PostgreSQL database connection
```

**Success Criteria**:
- All containers running and healthy
- Monitoring dashboard accessible and responsive
- PostgreSQL database operational
- WebSocket connections stable
- API endpoints responding correctly

#### 2. Validate Real Dual-Agent Coordination (HIGH PRIORITY)
**Project Context**: Use orthodox-synagogue-auction-platform for realistic testing
**Action Required**:
```bash
# Test actual dual-agent coordination with real project
cd path/to/orthodox-synagogue-auction-platform
acc run "implement comprehensive user authentication system with JWT, password hashing, and role-based permissions" --dual-agent -i 5 -v

# Monitor the session via dashboard at http://localhost:6011
# Verify Manager creates proper work items
# Confirm Worker executes assigned tasks
# Check monitoring events are captured correctly
```

**Success Criteria**:
- Manager successfully analyzes complex authentication task
- Manager creates multiple actionable work items
- Worker executes each work item effectively
- All Manager-Worker handoffs captured in monitoring dashboard
- Session persistence works correctly
- Quality gates function properly

#### 3. Test Webhook Notification System (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
**Current Status**: Infrastructure exists but untested
**Action Required**:
```bash
# Configure test webhook endpoints
# Test Slack/Discord/email notifications
# Validate notification payload formatting
# Verify error handling and retry logic
```

**Success Criteria**:
- Webhook endpoints receive proper notifications
- Notification content is correctly formatted
- External service integrations work
- Error scenarios handled gracefully

### Expected Session Outcomes

#### Technical Deliverables
1. **Fully Functional Docker Environment**: Complete containerized setup with all services operational
2. **Validated Dual-Agent Coordination**: Proven Manager-Worker handoffs with real project work
3. **Comprehensive Monitoring**: Real-time dashboard showing actual agent coordination events
4. **Production Readiness**: System validated for production deployment scenarios

#### Documentation Updates
1. **Session Recap**: Document validation results and any issues discovered
2. **Roadmap Progress**: Mark completed validation milestones
3. **Setup Guide**: Update with any Docker environment refinements
4. **Testing Documentation**: Record successful test scenarios and configurations

### Potential Issues to Address

#### Docker Environment Issues
- Container build failures or connectivity problems
- PostgreSQL initialization or connection issues
- Port conflicts with existing services
- Volume mount or permission problems

#### Dual-Agent Coordination Issues  
- Manager failing to create proper work items with real tasks
- Worker not executing assigned work effectively
- Monitoring events not generating or capturing correctly
- Session persistence or replay problems

#### Performance Issues
- Slow container startup or response times
- Memory usage optimization needs
- Database performance under load
- WebSocket connection stability

### Session Success Metrics

#### Functional Metrics
- ✅ Docker environment fully operational (all containers healthy)
- ✅ Real dual-agent session completes successfully  
- ✅ Monitoring dashboard captures all coordination events
- ✅ Manager-Worker handoffs function properly
- ✅ Session replay works correctly

#### Performance Metrics
- Container startup time < 2 minutes
- API response time < 500ms
- WebSocket latency < 100ms
- Database query performance acceptable
- Memory usage within reasonable limits

#### Quality Metrics
- No critical errors during dual-agent execution
- All monitoring events captured accurately
- Webhook notifications work correctly
- Session data persisted properly
- Documentation updated comprehensively

### Pre-Session Setup
1. Ensure Docker Desktop is running
2. Verify adequate system resources (RAM, disk space)
3. Confirm Claude Code CLI is functional
4. Check network connectivity for external integrations
5. Backup current configuration before testing

This prompt ensures the next session will focus on completing the validation phase and achieving production readiness for the dual-agent monitoring system.
