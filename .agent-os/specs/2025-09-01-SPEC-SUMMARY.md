3. CI/CD Consolidation - Improves reliability
4. Developer Experience - Low effort, high impact

### Medium Priority (Quality & Performance)
5. Service Modularization - Major refactoring effort
6. Test Coverage Enhancement - Long-term reliability
7. Monorepo Structure - Better dependency management
8. Docker Monitoring - Operational visibility

### Long-term Strategic
9. Error Recovery Mechanisms - Enterprise reliability
10. Performance Optimization - Scalability

13. Plugin System - Ecosystem expansion

## Total Estimated Effort
- **Quick Wins** (1-7): ~2 weeks
- **Core Improvements** (5-8): ~8 weeks
- **Strategic Initiatives** (9-13): ~6 months

## Next Steps
1. Review and approve specifications
2. Prioritize based on immediate needs
3. Begin with high-priority quick wins
4. Run `/create-tasks` for individual specs to generate detailed task lists
5. Execute tasks using `/execute-tasks` command

## Notes
- All specs follow Agent OS template structure
- Each includes technical specifications and comprehensive task breakdowns
- Dependencies between specs have been considered in priority ordering
- Implementation can proceed in parallel for independent specs
