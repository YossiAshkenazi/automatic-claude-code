# Advanced Agent Coordination Patterns - Lite Summary

Extend the dual-agent architecture with sophisticated multi-agent coordination patterns including pipelines, consensus mechanisms, dynamic task decomposition, and conflict resolution for complex development workflows.

## Key Points
- **Pipeline Processing**: Sequential and parallel agent workflows with quality gates and automated handoffs
- **Consensus Mechanisms**: Multi-agent decision making through voting, scoring, and negotiation protocols  
- **Dynamic Task Decomposition**: Real-time task breakdown that adapts based on system state and agent capabilities
- **Conflict Resolution**: Automated resolution of contradictory agent solutions through rule-based and AI-mediated protocols
- **Pattern Selection**: Intelligent coordination pattern selection based on task characteristics and performance metrics
