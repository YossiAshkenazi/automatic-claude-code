# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: Advanced Agent Coordination Patterns
> Created: 2025-09-01
> Status: Planning

## Overview

This specification defines advanced coordination patterns that extend beyond the basic Manager-Worker dual-agent architecture. The system will implement sophisticated multi-agent coordination patterns including pipeline processing, consensus mechanisms, dynamic task decomposition, and automated conflict resolution to enable complex, large-scale AI-assisted development workflows.

## User Stories

### Pipeline Coordination
- As a developer, I want to execute multi-stage development pipelines where agents pass work through coordinated stages (research → planning → implementation → testing → documentation) so that complex projects follow structured workflows
- As a team lead, I want pipeline agents to automatically validate handoffs between stages to ensure quality gates are met before proceeding

### Consensus Decision Making
- As a developer working on architectural decisions, I want multiple specialist agents to evaluate options and reach consensus so that critical decisions are well-validated
- As a system architect, I want consensus mechanisms that can handle disagreements between agents through structured negotiation protocols

### Dynamic Task Decomposition
- As a developer with complex requirements, I want the system to dynamically break down tasks into optimal subtasks based on current system state and agent capabilities
- As a project manager, I want task decomposition that adapts in real-time as requirements change or blockers are encountered

### Conflict Resolution
- As a developer, I want automatic conflict resolution when agents propose contradictory solutions so that development doesn't stall
- As a quality assurance lead, I want conflict resolution mechanisms that preserve the best aspects of competing solutions

## Spec Scope

### Core Coordination Patterns
- **Pipeline Patterns**: Sequential, parallel, and hybrid pipeline architectures
- **Consensus Mechanisms**: Voting, scoring, and negotiation-based consensus algorithms
- **Task Decomposition**: Hierarchical, graph-based, and adaptive decomposition strategies
- **Conflict Resolution**: Rule-based, AI-mediated, and human-escalation protocols

### Advanced Features
- **Agent Specialization**: Role-based agent assignment and capability matching
- **Load Balancing**: Dynamic agent allocation based on workload and performance
- **Quality Assurance**: Multi-agent validation and cross-verification systems
- **Performance Optimization**: Coordination pattern selection based on task characteristics

### Integration Points
- **Existing Dual-Agent System**: Backward compatibility with current Manager-Worker patterns
- **Monitoring Dashboard**: Extended visualization for multi-agent coordination
- **External APIs**: Webhook integration for coordination events
- **Session Management**: Enhanced session tracking for complex multi-agent workflows

## Out of Scope

- Complete rewrite of existing dual-agent architecture (must be additive)
- Real-time collaborative editing between multiple human users
- Integration with external AI services beyond Claude Code
- Blockchain-based consensus mechanisms (overkill for development workflows)
- Support for more than 10 concurrent coordinating agents (performance boundary)

## Expected Deliverable

A comprehensive multi-agent coordination system that:

1. **Extends Current Architecture**: Builds upon existing Manager-Worker foundation
2. **Supports Multiple Patterns**: Implements 4+ distinct coordination patterns
3. **Provides Pattern Selection**: Automatically chooses optimal coordination based on task type
4. **Maintains Performance**: Coordination overhead <20% of single-agent execution
5. **Offers Monitoring**: Real-time visualization of multi-agent interactions
6. **Ensures Reliability**: Graceful degradation when coordination fails
