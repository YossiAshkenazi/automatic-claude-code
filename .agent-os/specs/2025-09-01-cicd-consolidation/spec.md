# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: CI/CD Pipeline Consolidation
> Created: 2025-09-01
> Status: Planning

## Overview

The project currently maintains 4 redundant CI/CD workflow files (simple-ci.yml, main.yml, ci.yml, and workflow variations) that create maintenance overhead, inconsistent behavior, and duplicate execution. This spec consolidates these into a single, comprehensive GitHub Actions workflow that serves as the single source of truth for all CI/CD operations.

## User Stories

**As a developer**, I want a single CI/CD workflow so that I don't have to maintain multiple similar configurations with subtle differences.

**As a maintainer**, I want consistent build and test behavior across all pull requests and pushes so that I can trust the CI results.

**As a contributor**, I want fast feedback from CI/CD so that I can iterate quickly without waiting for redundant pipeline executions.

**As a DevOps engineer**, I want optimized caching and matrix builds so that CI resources are used efficiently and build times are minimized.

## Spec Scope

### In Scope
- Consolidate 4 existing workflow files into single comprehensive workflow
- Implement matrix builds for multiple Node.js versions and platforms
- Add intelligent caching for node_modules, pnpm store, and build artifacts
- Implement fail-fast behavior for quick feedback on failures
- Maintain all existing functionality (testing, building, Docker, publishing)
- Add conditional job execution based on changed files
- Preserve GitHub Container Registry publishing capability
- Maintain multi-architecture Docker build support (linux/amd64, linux/arm64)

### Enhanced Features
- Smart dependency caching with cache invalidation
- Parallel job execution where possible
- Matrix strategy for comprehensive platform testing
- Conditional workflows based on file changes
- Enhanced error reporting and artifact collection
- Build performance metrics and timing

## Out of Scope

- Migrating to different CI/CD platforms (GitHub Actions remains)
- Changing existing package.json scripts or build processes
- Modifying Docker configurations beyond workflow integration
- Adding new testing frameworks or build tools
- Changing release/versioning strategies

## Expected Deliverable

A single `.github/workflows/ci.yml` file that:
- Replaces all existing workflow files
- Provides comprehensive CI/CD functionality
- Uses matrix builds for efficiency
- Implements intelligent caching
- Maintains backward compatibility with existing processes
- Reduces overall CI execution time by 40-50%
- Provides clear, actionable feedback on failures
