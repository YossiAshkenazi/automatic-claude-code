# Spec Tasks

These are the tasks to be completed for the spec detailed in @.agent-os/specs/2025-09-01-cicd-consolidation/spec.md

> Created: 2025-09-01
> Status: Ready for Implementation

## Tasks

### Phase 1: Analysis and Discovery
- [ ] **Task 1.1**: Audit existing workflow files
  - Analyze `.github/workflows/simple-ci.yml`
  - Analyze `.github/workflows/main.yml`
  - Analyze `.github/workflows/ci.yml`
  - Document unique features and requirements from each
  - Identify redundant configurations and overlapping functionality

- [ ] **Task 1.2**: Map current CI/CD functionality
  - Document all existing jobs and their purposes
  - Identify job dependencies and execution order
  - Map trigger conditions and branch strategies
  - Catalog environment variables and secrets usage

### Phase 2: Design Consolidated Workflow
- [ ] **Task 2.1**: Design unified job structure
  - Create comprehensive job dependency graph
  - Design matrix strategy for Node.js versions and platforms
  - Plan conditional execution logic for different change types
  - Define fail-fast and error handling strategies

- [ ] **Task 2.2**: Design caching strategy
  - Plan pnpm store caching implementation
  - Design node_modules caching with proper invalidation
  - Plan build artifact caching (TypeScript compilation, dist/)
  - Design Docker layer caching for container builds

- [ ] **Task 2.3**: Design conditional execution
  - Create file change detection patterns
  - Design job skip conditions for irrelevant changes
  - Plan label-based job triggering for PRs
  - Design branch-specific job execution (main vs feature branches)

### Phase 3: Implementation
- [ ] **Task 3.1**: Create consolidated workflow file
  - Create new `.github/workflows/ci.yml`
  - Implement matrix build strategy
  - Add comprehensive caching configuration
  - Implement conditional job execution

- [ ] **Task 3.2**: Implement job definitions
  - **lint-and-typecheck job**: ESLint and TypeScript validation
  - **test-matrix job**: Unit and integration tests across platforms
  - **build-matrix job**: Build verification and artifact generation
  - **docker-build job**: Multi-architecture container builds
  - **publish job**: Conditional publishing to GitHub Container Registry

- [ ] **Task 3.3**: Implement optimization features
  - Add intelligent dependency caching
  - Implement fail-fast behavior with proper error reporting
  - Add build performance timing and metrics
  - Implement artifact collection for debugging

### Phase 4: Testing and Validation
- [ ] **Task 4.1**: Test workflow scenarios
  - Test PR workflow execution
  - Test main branch push workflow
  - Test release/tag workflow
  - Validate matrix build execution across all combinations

- [ ] **Task 4.2**: Validate functionality preservation
  - Verify all existing CI functionality works
  - Test Docker builds and GHCR publishing
  - Validate test execution and reporting
  - Confirm build artifact generation

- [ ] **Task 4.3**: Performance validation
  - Measure build time improvements
  - Validate cache hit rates
  - Confirm parallel job execution
  - Test fail-fast behavior and feedback timing

### Phase 5: Migration and Cleanup
- [ ] **Task 5.1**: Deploy consolidated workflow
  - Enable new consolidated workflow
  - Monitor initial executions for issues
  - Validate all functionality in production
  - Collect performance metrics

- [ ] **Task 5.2**: Remove redundant workflows
  - Remove `.github/workflows/simple-ci.yml`
  - Remove `.github/workflows/main.yml`  
  - Remove duplicate `.github/workflows/ci.yml` variations
  - Update any documentation referencing old workflows

- [ ] **Task 5.3**: Documentation updates
  - Update README.md with new CI/CD information
  - Update CLAUDE.md with consolidated workflow details
  - Update development documentation
  - Create workflow maintenance guidelines

### Acceptance Criteria

#### Functional Requirements
