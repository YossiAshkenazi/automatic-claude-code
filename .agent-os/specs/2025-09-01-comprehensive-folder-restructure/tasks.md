These are the tasks to be completed for the spec detailed in @.agent-os/specs/2025-09-01-comprehensive-folder-restructure/spec.md

> Created: 2025-09-01
> Status: Ready for Implementation

## Tasks

### 1. Documentation Reorganization and Structure Creation

- [ ] 1.1. Write comprehensive tests for documentation structure validation (verify all markdown files exist, cross-references work, and navigation links are valid)
- [ ] 1.2. Create complete documentation directory structure (docs/ with setup/, deployment/, development/, operations/, reference/, and research/ subdirectories)
- [ ] 1.3. Move root markdown files to appropriate docs/ subdirectories (QUICK-SETUP.md → docs/setup/, DEPLOYMENT.md → docs/deployment/, CHANGELOG.md → docs/reference/)
- [ ] 1.4. Migrate research documents to docs/reference/research/ directory (Agent-Coordination-Patterns*.md, CLAUDE_DESKTOP_RESEARCH_PROMPT.md)
- [ ] 1.5. Update internal documentation cross-references and relative links to new locations
- [ ] 1.6. Create README.md files for each docs/ subdirectory explaining their purpose and organization
- [ ] 1.7. Update root README.md to reference new documentation structure and provide navigation guide
- [ ] 1.8. Verify documentation tests pass and all links resolve correctly

### 2. Test File Consolidation and Test Infrastructure Setup

- [ ] 2.1. Write tests for test infrastructure validation (verify test runners work, configs load properly, and directory structure is correct)
- [ ] 2.2. Create comprehensive test directory structure (tests/ with unit/, integration/, e2e/, load/, fixtures/, and support/ subdirectories)
- [ ] 2.3. Create placeholder test files for major components (agent coordination, CLI commands, monitoring system, configuration management)
- [ ] 2.4. Move existing test scripts and PowerShell files from root to appropriate tests/ subdirectories
- [ ] 2.5. Create test configuration files in config/testing/ directory (jest.config.js, vitest.config.ts, playwright.config.ts)
- [ ] 2.6. Set up test fixtures and mock data structure in tests/fixtures/ with sample sessions and test data
- [ ] 2.7. Create test support utilities (test-helpers.ts, setup.ts, teardown.ts) in tests/support/
- [ ] 2.8. Verify all test infrastructure tests pass and test runners execute correctly

### 3. Configuration Management and Environment Setup

- [ ] 3.1. Write tests for configuration management (verify configs load correctly, environment variables resolve, and all deployment scenarios work)
- [ ] 3.2. Create configuration directory structure (config/ with development/, production/, testing/, monitoring/, and base/ subdirectories)
- [ ] 3.3. Move and reorganize scattered config files (ecosystem.config.js → config/production/, Docker Compose files → appropriate environment dirs)
- [ ] 3.4. Create environment-specific configuration files (.env.development, .env.production.example with proper port standardization)
- [ ] 3.5. Consolidate TypeScript configurations with proper extends hierarchies (tsconfig.base.json in config/base/)
- [ ] 3.6. Set up monitoring configuration files (prometheus.yml, grafana-dashboards/) in config/monitoring/
- [ ] 3.7. Update .gitignore patterns for new config structure and add necessary ignore rules
- [ ] 3.8. Verify configuration management tests pass and all environments load correctly

### 4. Source Code Modularization and CLI Structure Refactoring

- [ ] 4.1. Write comprehensive tests for CLI command functionality (test each command module, middleware system, and help formatter)
- [ ] 4.2. Create new CLI command structure (src/cli/ with commands/, middleware/, utils/, and index.ts)
- [ ] 4.3. Extract individual command handlers from monolithic src/index.ts (run.ts, monitor.ts, history.ts, logs.ts, examples.ts, config.ts)
- [ ] 4.4. Implement command middleware system (authentication.ts, validation.ts, logging.ts) with proper error handling
- [ ] 4.5. Create CLI utility modules (command-builder.ts, option-parser.ts, help-formatter.ts) for better modularity
- [ ] 4.6. Update all source file imports to use new CLI structure and TypeScript path mappings
- [ ] 4.7. Refactor main entry point (src/index.ts) to use new command-based architecture while preserving all functionality
- [ ] 4.8. Verify CLI functionality tests pass and all commands work exactly as before refactoring

### 5. Port Standardization, Docker Configuration, and Deployment Validation

- [ ] 5.1. Write comprehensive tests for port configuration and deployment scenarios (test all ports resolve correctly, Docker builds work, monitoring connects properly)
- [ ] 5.2. Implement standardized port configuration across all environments (resolve 4001 vs 4005 conflicts, maintain 6007 and 6011 consistency)
- [ ] 5.3. Update Docker and Docker Compose files for new directory structure (fix volume mappings, update COPY instructions, test both dev and prod)
- [ ] 5.4. Update package.json scripts to reference new file locations (tests, build configs, Docker compose files)
- [ ] 5.5. Fix all import path references in source files, hook scripts, and monitoring system components
- [ ] 5.6. Update CI/CD pipeline configurations (.github/workflows/) to use new directory structure and config paths
- [ ] 5.7. Test complete system functionality including dual-agent coordination, monitoring dashboard, and all deployment scenarios
- [ ] 5.8. Verify all deployment and port configuration tests pass, ensuring zero breaking changes to existing functionality
