> Spec: Dashboard UI Enhancement
> Created: 2025-09-01
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Fix critical UI/UX issues in the dual-agent monitoring dashboard by implementing responsive design patterns, resolving data consistency problems, and establishing a cohesive visual design system. Enhance mobile experience and optimize performance for real-time agent monitoring across all device types.

## User Stories

1. **As a developer monitoring dual-agent sessions**, I want a responsive dashboard that works seamlessly on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices so that I can track agent coordination from any device without losing functionality or visual clarity.

2. **As a team lead reviewing agent performance**, I want consistent, real-time data updates with reliable WebSocket connections so that I can make informed decisions about agent effectiveness without encountering stale data or connection issues.

3. **As a mobile developer working remotely**, I want an optimized mobile interface with touch-friendly controls and efficient data loading so that I can monitor and manage dual-agent sessions while away from my desk.

## Spec Scope

1. **Responsive Design Implementation**
   - Mobile-first CSS architecture with breakpoint-based layouts
   - Flexible grid systems for agent communication visualization
   - Touch-optimized UI components and navigation patterns
   - Adaptive chart rendering for different screen sizes

2. **Data Consistency & Real-time Updates**
   - WebSocket connection reliability improvements with auto-reconnection
   - State management optimization using Zustand with persistence
   - Real-time data synchronization between multiple dashboard instances
   - Error boundary implementation for graceful failure handling

3. **Visual Design System**
   - Consistent component library with standardized colors, typography, and spacing
   - Dark/light theme implementation with system preference detection
   - Agent-specific color coding and visual indicators
   - Accessible design patterns meeting WCAG 2.1 standards

4. **Mobile Experience Optimization**
   - Progressive Web App (PWA) capabilities with offline support
   - Mobile-specific layouts for agent communication flows
   - Touch gestures for timeline navigation and data exploration
   - Performance optimization for lower-powered mobile devices

5. **Performance Enhancements**
   - Virtual scrolling for large datasets and session history
   - Lazy loading of dashboard components and visualizations
   - Memory optimization for long-running monitoring sessions
   - Bundle size reduction and code splitting implementation

## Out of Scope

- New dashboard features or functionality beyond UI/UX improvements
- Backend API changes or WebSocket server modifications
- Authentication system modifications or user management features
- Integration with external monitoring tools or services
- Database schema changes or migration procedures
- Advanced analytics or machine learning dashboard features

## Expected Deliverable

1. **Fully Responsive Dashboard**: All dashboard components render correctly and maintain full functionality across desktop (1920px+), tablet (768-1024px), and mobile (320-767px) viewports with touch-optimized interactions.

2. **Real-time Data Reliability**: WebSocket connections maintain stable real-time updates with automatic reconnection, consistent state management, and zero data loss during network interruptions or browser tab switching.

3. **Production-Ready Mobile Experience**: PWA-enabled dashboard with offline capabilities, mobile-optimized layouts, and performance metrics showing <3 second initial load times and <100ms interaction response times on standard mobile devices.
