# Developer Experience Improvements - Lite Summary

Standardize development practices across the Automatic Claude Code project by implementing .editorconfig for consistent formatting, CODEOWNERS for clear responsibilities, and CONTRIBUTING.md for streamlined onboarding.

## Key Points
- **Consistent Coding**: EditorConfig ensures uniform indentation, line endings, and encoding across all editors and contributors
- **Clear Ownership**: CODEOWNERS file establishes review responsibilities and contact points for different codebase areas
- **Streamlined Onboarding**: Comprehensive CONTRIBUTING.md reduces friction for new contributors with clear guidelines and processes
