# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: Developer Experience Improvements
> Created: 2025-09-01
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Enhance the developer experience for the Automatic Claude Code project by implementing standardized development configurations, clear ownership guidelines, and comprehensive contribution documentation. This will improve code consistency, streamline onboarding, and establish clear responsibilities across the codebase.

## User Stories

**As a new contributor**, I want clear guidance on coding standards and contribution processes so I can quickly understand how to contribute effectively to the project.

**As a maintainer**, I want automated code formatting and consistent styles so I can focus on code review quality rather than style nitpicking.

**As a team member**, I want clear ownership information so I know who to contact for specific areas of the codebase and can get faster reviews.

**As a developer**, I want my editor to automatically apply consistent formatting so my code matches project standards without manual effort.

## Spec Scope

### Core Components
1. **EditorConfig Implementation**
   - Cross-editor consistency for indentation, line endings, and character encoding
   - Support for TypeScript, JavaScript, JSON, YAML, and Markdown files
   - Integration with existing tooling (ESLint, Prettier)

2. **CODEOWNERS Configuration**
   - Clear ownership mapping for different parts of the codebase
   - Required review assignments for critical areas
   - Team and individual ownership definitions

3. **Contributing Guidelines**
   - Comprehensive onboarding documentation
   - Code style and quality standards
   - Pull request and review processes
   - Testing requirements and guidelines
   - Issue reporting and feature request processes

4. **Development Workflow Integration**
   - Git hooks integration for automated checks
   - IDE/editor configuration recommendations
   - Local development setup instructions

## Out of Scope

- Major refactoring of existing code to match new standards
- Implementation of new CI/CD pipelines (existing workflows will be enhanced)
- Migration of existing issues or PRs to new templates
- Advanced security scanning beyond current capabilities

## Expected Deliverable

A comprehensive developer experience package including:
- `.editorconfig` file with project-wide editor settings
- `.github/CODEOWNERS` file with clear ownership assignments
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` with detailed contribution guidelines
- Updated documentation reflecting new development practices
- Integration with existing tooling and workflows
