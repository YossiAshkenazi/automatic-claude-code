> Status: Planning

## Overview

Implement comprehensive Docker container monitoring integrated with the existing dual-agent monitoring dashboard to provide real-time visibility into containerized deployments. This feature will enable developers and operators to track container health, resource usage, and logs through a unified interface, improving operational visibility and reducing debugging time.

## User Stories

### Container Health Monitoring

As a developer, I want to see the real-time health status of all Docker containers running the automatic-claude-code system, so that I can quickly identify and respond to container failures or issues.

The monitoring dashboard will display a container overview showing each container's status (running, stopped, restarting), uptime, and health check results. When a container fails or restarts unexpectedly, the system will highlight the issue and provide access to recent logs to help diagnose the problem.

### Resource Usage Tracking

As a system operator, I want to monitor CPU, memory, disk, and network usage for each container, so that I can optimize resource allocation and identify performance bottlenecks.

The dashboard will show real-time and historical resource metrics with configurable thresholds for alerts. Users can view trends over time to identify patterns and make informed decisions about scaling or resource allocation.

### Log Aggregation and Search

As a developer debugging issues, I want to search and filter logs across all containers from a central interface, so that I can trace issues across the distributed system without accessing individual containers.

The system will aggregate logs from all containers, providing search, filtering by container/severity/time, and the ability to correlate logs with system events and metrics for comprehensive debugging.

## Spec Scope

1. **Container Status Dashboard** - Real-time display of container health, uptime, and restart counts with visual indicators for status
2. **Resource Metrics Collection** - Gather and display CPU, memory, disk I/O, and network metrics for each container with configurable alert thresholds
3. **Log Aggregation System** - Centralized log collection from all containers with search, filtering, and correlation capabilities
4. **Docker Events Monitoring** - Track and display container lifecycle events (start, stop, restart, health check failures)
5. **Integration with Existing Dashboard** - Add Docker monitoring as a new section in the current dual-agent monitoring UI

## Out of Scope

- Kubernetes or Docker Swarm orchestration monitoring
- Container image vulnerability scanning
- Automated container scaling or orchestration
- Third-party container monitoring (only automatic-claude-code containers)
- Long-term log storage beyond 7 days

## Expected Deliverable

1. Docker monitoring tab in the existing dashboard showing container status, metrics, and logs
2. Real-time WebSocket updates for container status changes and metric updates
3. Functional log search and filtering interface with export capabilities
