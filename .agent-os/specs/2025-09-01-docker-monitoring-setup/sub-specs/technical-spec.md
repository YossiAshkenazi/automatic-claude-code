# Technical Specification

This is the technical specification for the spec detailed in @.agent-os/specs/2025-09-01-docker-monitoring-setup/spec.md

> Created: 2025-09-01
> Version: 1.0.0

## Technical Requirements

### Docker Integration
- Connect to Docker daemon via Docker Engine API (REST or Socket)
- Support both local Docker socket (/var/run/docker.sock) and remote Docker API endpoints
- Implement connection pooling for efficient API calls
- Handle Docker API version compatibility (minimum Docker 20.10)

### Data Collection Architecture
- Polling interval: 5 seconds for container status, 10 seconds for metrics
- Use Docker stats API for real-time resource metrics
- Stream container logs using Docker logs API with follow mode
- Buffer and batch metric updates to reduce WebSocket message frequency

### Performance Requirements
- Dashboard should handle monitoring up to 50 containers simultaneously
- Metric queries should return within 200ms for real-time data
- Log search should return results within 500ms for 7-day window
- WebSocket connections should auto-reconnect within 5 seconds of disconnection

### UI/UX Specifications
- Add "Docker Monitoring" tab to existing dashboard navigation
- Container grid view with status badges (green=running, red=stopped, yellow=restarting)
- Sparkline charts for CPU/memory trends in container cards
- Collapsible log viewer with syntax highlighting and severity-based coloring
- Responsive design maintaining functionality on mobile devices

### Data Storage
- Store metrics in PostgreSQL with time-series optimization (partitioning by day)
- Implement data retention policy: high-resolution (5-second) data for 24 hours, aggregated (1-minute) data for 7 days
- Index logs by container_id, timestamp, and severity for fast queries
- Use Redis for caching frequently accessed metrics and container states

### Security Considerations
- Sanitize container names and IDs before display to prevent XSS
- Implement rate limiting on log queries to prevent DoS
- Mask sensitive environment variables in container inspection data
- Use read-only Docker API access where possible

## External Dependencies

- **dockerode** (^4.0.0) - Node.js Docker client library for API interactions
- **Justification:** Well-maintained, TypeScript support, comprehensive Docker API coverage, better than raw API calls

- **pino** (^8.0.0) - High-performance logging library for structured log processing
- **Justification:** Fast JSON logging, built-in log rotation support, lower overhead than Winston for high-volume container logs

- **date-fns** (^3.0.0) - Date manipulation for time-series data
- **Justification:** Lighter than moment.js, better tree-shaking, already used in the project
