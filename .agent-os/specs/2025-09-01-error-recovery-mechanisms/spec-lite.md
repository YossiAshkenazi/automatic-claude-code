# Enhanced Error Recovery Mechanisms - Lite Summary

Build a comprehensive error recovery system for the dual-agent architecture that automatically detects, classifies, and recovers from failures while providing graceful degradation and detailed monitoring.

## Key Points
- **Intelligent Retry Logic**: Exponential backoff with jitter for transient failures, configurable retry policies per component
- **Circuit Breaker Protection**: Fail-fast mechanisms to prevent cascade failures with automatic recovery testing
- **Graceful Degradation**: Seamless fallback to single-agent mode when dual-agent coordination fails, maintaining core functionality
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Error dashboard with analytics, alerting, and health checks for proactive issue management
- **Recovery Automation**: Automated workflows for common failure scenarios with minimal manual intervention required
