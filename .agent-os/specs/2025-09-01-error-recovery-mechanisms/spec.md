# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: Enhanced Error Recovery Mechanisms
> Created: 2025-09-01
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Implement comprehensive error recovery mechanisms for the dual-agent system to ensure robust operation, minimize downtime, and provide graceful degradation when failures occur. The system should automatically detect, classify, and recover from various error conditions while maintaining operational continuity and providing detailed error reporting for monitoring and debugging.

## User Stories

**As a developer using the dual-agent system, I want:**
- Automatic recovery from transient network failures so my workflow isn't interrupted
- Clear visibility into error conditions and recovery attempts through the monitoring dashboard
- Graceful degradation to single-agent mode when dual-agent coordination fails
- Automatic retry logic with exponential backoff for failed operations
- Circuit breaker protection to prevent cascade failures in external dependencies

**As a system administrator, I want:**
- Comprehensive error metrics and alerting to proactively address issues
- Configurable error recovery policies to match operational requirements
- Detailed error logs with context for debugging and analysis
- Health checks and monitoring to track system reliability
- Automated recovery workflows that reduce manual intervention

**As a product owner, I want:**
- High system availability and resilience to maintain user productivity
- Predictable error handling behavior across all system components
- Cost-effective error recovery that minimizes resource waste
- User-friendly error messages that guide users toward resolution
- Analytics on error patterns to inform system improvements

## Spec Scope

### Core Error Recovery Features
- **Intelligent Retry Logic**: Exponential backoff, jitter, and max retry limits
- **Circuit Breaker Implementation**: Fail-fast protection with automatic recovery testing
- **Graceful Degradation**: Fallback to single-agent mode when dual-agent coordination fails
- **Error Classification**: Categorize errors by type, severity, and recoverability
- **Recovery Workflows**: Automated sequences for common failure scenarios

### Monitoring and Observability
- **Real-time Error Dashboard**: Live error tracking and recovery status
- **Error Analytics**: Pattern detection, trend analysis, and predictive insights
- **Alerting System**: Configurable notifications for critical error conditions
- **Health Check Framework**: Comprehensive system health monitoring
- **Error Correlation**: Link related errors across distributed components

### Configuration and Control
- **Policy Configuration**: Customizable error recovery policies per component
- **Manual Override**: Administrative controls for error recovery behavior
- **Testing Framework**: Chaos engineering tools for error recovery validation
- **Performance Impact Control**: Resource limits for error recovery operations

## Out of Scope

- **Infrastructure-level Failures**: Server crashes, network outages (handled by deployment layer)
- **Claude API Service Outages**: External service availability (beyond our control)
- **Data Corruption Recovery**: Database-level corruption handling (covered by backup/restore)
- **Security Incident Response**: Security-related error handling (separate security spec)
- **Client-side Error Recovery**: Browser/UI error handling (separate frontend spec)

## Expected Deliverable

A production-ready error recovery system that:

1. **Reduces System Downtime**: 99.9% uptime through automatic error recovery
2. **Improves User Experience**: Seamless recovery with minimal user impact
3. **Provides Operational Visibility**: Comprehensive error monitoring and reporting
4. **Enables Proactive Management**: Predictive error detection and prevention
5. **Maintains Performance**: Error recovery with minimal performance overhead
6. **Supports Multiple Environments**: Consistent behavior across dev/staging/production

### Key Metrics
- Error recovery success rate > 95%
- Mean time to recovery (MTTR) < 30 seconds
- False positive rate for circuit breakers < 5%
- Error detection accuracy > 99%
- Performance overhead < 10% during normal operations
