# Proper Monorepo Structure - Lite Summary

Transform the current project into a true monorepo with pnpm workspaces, separating CLI and monitoring packages while optimizing dependencies and unifying development workflows.

## Key Points
- **Workspace Organization**: Separate packages for CLI (`packages/cli`) and monitoring (`packages/monitor`) with shared utilities
- **Dependency Optimization**: Hoist shared dependencies to root, eliminate duplicates, improve install performance
- **Unified Tooling**: Root-level scripts for build/test/lint across all packages with consistent configuration
