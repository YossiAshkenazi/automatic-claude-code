# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: Proper Monorepo Structure
> Created: 2025-09-01
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Transform the current project into a proper monorepo structure using pnpm workspaces to improve maintainability, dependency management, and development workflow. This involves reorganizing the codebase to separate the main CLI application and monitoring dashboard into distinct workspace packages while maintaining their integration.

## User Stories

**As a developer**, I want a properly structured monorepo so that I can:
- Manage dependencies more efficiently with shared packages
- Run unified build/test/lint commands across all packages
- Maintain consistent tooling and configuration
- Reduce duplicate dependencies and improve install times
- Enable better code sharing between packages

**As a maintainer**, I want clear package boundaries so that I can:
- Understand the architecture at a glance
- Make changes to one package without affecting others unnecessarily
- Publish packages independently if needed
- Implement consistent CI/CD across all packages

**As a contributor**, I want standardized tooling so that I can:
- Use the same development commands across all packages
- Follow consistent code formatting and linting rules
- Run tests for specific packages or the entire monorepo
- Understand the project structure quickly

## Spec Scope

### Core Monorepo Structure
- Root-level `pnpm-workspace.yaml` configuration
- Separate packages for CLI (`packages/cli`) and monitoring (`packages/monitor`)
- Shared configuration packages (`packages/shared-config`, `packages/types`)
- Root-level unified scripts for build, test, lint operations
- Consistent tooling configuration (TypeScript, ESLint, Prettier)

### Package Organization
- `packages/cli/` - Main automatic-claude-code CLI application
- `packages/monitor/` - Dual-agent monitoring dashboard
- `packages/types/` - Shared TypeScript type definitions
- `packages/shared-config/` - Common configuration files and utilities
- Root-level development and tooling configuration

### Dependency Management
- Shared dependencies hoisted to root level
- Package-specific dependencies in respective package.json files
- Consistent versioning across all packages
- Optimized dependency resolution and caching

## Out of Scope

- Changing the core functionality of existing components
- Modifying the dual-agent architecture
- Altering the monitoring dashboard features
- Breaking existing CLI command compatibility
- Publishing packages to npm registry (initially)

## Expected Deliverable

A properly structured monorepo with:
1. **Root Configuration**: pnpm-workspace.yaml, unified package.json, shared tooling configs
2. **Package Structure**: Separate packages with clear boundaries and responsibilities
3. **Dependency Optimization**: Shared dependencies hoisted, no duplicates, faster installs
4. **Unified Scripts**: Root-level commands for build, test, lint, dev workflows
5. **Documentation**: Updated README and setup instructions for monorepo workflow
6. **Migration Verification**: All existing functionality working after restructure
