# Multi-Project Orchestration - Lite Summary

Orchestrate multiple development projects simultaneously through intelligent resource allocation, dependency management, and unified monitoring - enabling teams to work efficiently across multiple codebases with complete project isolation.

## Key Points
- **Unified Dashboard**: Single interface to monitor and control multiple active projects with real-time status and progress tracking
- **Intelligent Resource Allocation**: Dynamic distribution of dual-agent resources based on project priority, workload, and computational requirements
- **Project Isolation with Coordination**: Complete separation of project contexts while enabling controlled cross-project dependency management and resource sharing
