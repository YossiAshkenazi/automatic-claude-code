# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: Multi-Project Orchestration
> Created: 2025-09-01
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Enable the Automatic Claude Code system to manage and coordinate multiple development projects simultaneously through a unified orchestration layer. This feature will allow developers to work across multiple codebases, track cross-project dependencies, allocate resources efficiently, and maintain project isolation while providing centralized monitoring and coordination.

## User Stories

- **As a team lead**, I want to orchestrate multiple projects simultaneously so that I can manage team resources across different codebases efficiently
- **As a developer**, I want to work on multiple projects without switching contexts so that I can maintain productivity across different assignments
- **As a project manager**, I want to track dependencies between projects so that I can identify blockers and coordinate releases
- **As a DevOps engineer**, I want to allocate computational resources across projects so that I can optimize system performance and costs
- **As a technical lead**, I want to maintain project isolation so that changes in one project don't affect others unexpectedly
- **As a stakeholder**, I want a unified dashboard to monitor all projects so that I can track overall development progress

## Spec Scope

- **Project Management**: Create, configure, and manage multiple project instances
- **Resource Allocation**: Dynamic allocation of agent resources across projects based on priority and workload
- **Dependency Tracking**: Map and manage cross-project dependencies and shared resources
- **Unified Monitoring**: Single dashboard interface for monitoring all active projects
- **Project Isolation**: Ensure complete separation of project contexts, configurations, and data
- **Cross-Project Coordination**: Enable controlled communication and resource sharing between projects
- **Load Balancing**: Intelligent distribution of computational resources and agent assignments
- **Priority Management**: Project prioritization system with dynamic resource reallocation
- **State Synchronization**: Maintain consistent state across project instances and monitoring systems
- **Session Management**: Independent session handling per project with cross-project session linking

## Out of Scope

- Multi-tenant user management (single organization focus)
- Complex billing and cost allocation systems
- External project management tool integrations (initial version)
- Real-time collaborative editing across projects
- Advanced workflow automation beyond basic orchestration
- Integration with enterprise identity providers
- Complex approval workflows for cross-project changes

## Expected Deliverable

A production-ready Multi-Project Orchestration system that enables:

1. **Project Instance Management**: Create, start, stop, and configure multiple project instances
2. **Unified Dashboard Interface**: Single interface showing status, progress, and metrics for all projects
3. **Resource Orchestration Engine**: Intelligent allocation of agents and computational resources
4. **Dependency Resolution System**: Automatic detection and management of cross-project dependencies
5. **Isolation Framework**: Complete separation of project contexts with controlled communication channels
6. **Monitoring and Analytics**: Comprehensive metrics, logging, and performance analytics across all projects
7. **Configuration Management**: Project-specific configurations with inheritance and override capabilities
8. **State Management**: Persistent state handling with backup and recovery for multi-project environments
