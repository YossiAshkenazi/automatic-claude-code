# Native Dependency Migration - Lite Summary

Replace sqlite3 with better-sqlite3 to eliminate node-gyp compilation issues and improve developer experience across all platforms.

## Key Points
- **Zero Build Dependencies**: Eliminates need for Python, Visual Studio Build Tools, or node-gyp during installation
- **Universal Compatibility**: Consistent installation and behavior across Windows, macOS, Linux, and ARM systems
- **Performance Boost**: Synchronous API design provides 2-3x faster database operations with lower memory usage
- **Developer Experience**: Simpler installation, faster CI/CD builds, and fewer support tickets
- **Deployment Reliability**: Docker builds complete faster without native compilation failures
