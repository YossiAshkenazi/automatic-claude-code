# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: Native Dependency Migration (sqlite3 â†’ better-sqlite3)
> Created: 2025-09-01
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Migrate from sqlite3 to better-sqlite3 to eliminate node-gyp compilation issues, improve developer experience, and enhance performance. The current sqlite3 dependency causes frequent installation failures, especially on Windows and ARM systems, requiring complex build tools and causing deployment friction.

## User Stories

**As a Developer**
- I want to install dependencies without needing Python, Visual Studio Build Tools, or node-gyp
- I want consistent installation across Windows, macOS, and Linux systems
- I want faster database operations with synchronous API design
- I want reliable deployment without compilation failures

**As a DevOps Engineer**  
- I want Docker builds to complete without native compilation steps
- I want consistent behavior across different node versions and architectures
- I want reduced container image sizes without build dependencies

**As a Project Maintainer**
- I want fewer support issues related to installation problems
- I want better performance for database operations
- I want maintained API compatibility with existing code

## Spec Scope

- Replace sqlite3 dependency with better-sqlite3 in package.json
- Update all database connection and query code to use better-sqlite3 API
- Migrate from callback-based to synchronous database operations
- Update error handling for synchronous operations
- Ensure backward compatibility with existing database files
- Update documentation and developer setup guides
- Validate migration in dual-agent-monitor and main application
- Test installation across multiple platforms and node versions

## Out of Scope

- Database schema changes (structure remains identical)
- Migration to different database systems (PostgreSQL, MySQL)
- Performance optimization beyond what better-sqlite3 provides natively
- Changes to database file formats or storage locations
- Modification of database backup/restore procedures

## Expected Deliverable

A fully migrated codebase that:
- Uses better-sqlite3 instead of sqlite3
- Installs without requiring node-gyp or native compilation
- Maintains 100% functional compatibility with existing features
- Provides improved performance for database operations
- Passes all existing tests and quality gates
- Includes updated documentation and migration guide
