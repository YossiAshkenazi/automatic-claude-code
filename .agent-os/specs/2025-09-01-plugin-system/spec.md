> Spec: Plugin System for Custom Agents
> Created: 2025-09-01
> Status: Planning

## Overview

A comprehensive plugin system that enables users to extend automatic-claude-code with custom agents, tools, and capabilities. The system provides a secure, sandboxed environment for third-party plugins with hot-reloading, lifecycle management, and marketplace integration for sharing and discovering agent extensions.

## User Stories

**As a Developer, I want to:**
- Create custom agent plugins using a simple SDK
- Hot-reload plugins during development without restarting the main application
- Distribute my plugins through a centralized marketplace
- Install and manage plugins through CLI commands
- Configure plugin-specific settings and permissions

**As a Power User, I want to:**
- Browse and install plugins from a marketplace
- Enable/disable plugins without affecting core functionality
- Update plugins automatically or manually
- Configure plugin permissions and sandbox restrictions
- Share plugin configurations with my team

**As a System Administrator, I want to:**
- Control which plugins can be installed in enterprise environments
- Monitor plugin resource usage and security
- Enforce security policies for plugin execution
- Audit plugin activities and access patterns
- Manage plugin versions across team deployments

## Spec Scope

**Core Plugin Infrastructure:**
- Plugin discovery and registration system
- Secure sandboxing with resource limits
- Hot-reloading and lifecycle management
- Plugin SDK with TypeScript support
- Configuration and settings management

**Marketplace Integration:**
- Plugin registry and discovery
- Version management and updates
- Rating and review system
- Documentation and examples
- Automated publishing pipeline

**Security & Sandboxing:**
- Isolated execution environments
- Permission-based access control
- Resource usage monitoring
- Security audit trails
- Malicious code detection

**Developer Experience:**
- Plugin development toolkit
- Testing framework for plugins
- Documentation generator
- Debug and monitoring tools
- Example templates and boilerplates

## Out of Scope

- Visual plugin development interface (GUI-based plugin creation)
- Plugin execution on remote servers (cloud-hosted plugins)
- Integration with external plugin marketplaces (GitHub, npm)
- Backward compatibility with pre-1.0 plugin formats
- Real-time collaborative plugin development features

## Expected Deliverable

A production-ready plugin system integrated into automatic-claude-code that enables:

1. **Plugin Development**: Complete SDK with TypeScript support, testing framework, and development tools
2. **Plugin Management**: CLI commands for install, update, enable/disable, and configuration
3. **Security System**: Sandboxed execution with configurable permissions and resource limits
4. **Marketplace**: Web-based plugin discovery, rating, and distribution platform
5. **Hot-Reloading**: Live plugin updates during development and production
6. **Documentation**: Comprehensive guides, API reference, and example plugins
