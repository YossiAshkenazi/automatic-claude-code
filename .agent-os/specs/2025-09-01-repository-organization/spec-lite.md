# Repository Organization and Cleanup - Lite Summary

Clean up the cluttered root directory (38+ files) by organizing scripts, archiving old documentation, and establishing a proper directory structure following Node.js/TypeScript best practices.

## Key Points
- **Move Scripts**: Centralize all PowerShell, batch, and shell scripts into `/scripts` directory with logical subdirectories
- **Archive Documentation**: Move outdated docs, migration guides, and implementation summaries to `/archive` folder
- **Clean Root**: Reduce root directory from 38+ files to <15 essential files (package.json, README.md, core configs only)
