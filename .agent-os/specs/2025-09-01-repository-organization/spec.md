# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: Repository Organization and Cleanup
> Created: 2025-09-01
> Status: Planning

## Overview

The automatic-claude-code repository has become cluttered with 38+ files in the root directory, including scripts, documentation, configuration files, and various project artifacts. This creates poor developer experience, makes navigation difficult, and violates standard repository organization practices. This spec addresses comprehensive repository cleanup and reorganization to establish a clean, maintainable project structure.

## User Stories

**As a developer**, I want a clean repository structure so that I can quickly locate files and understand the project organization without confusion.

**As a new contributor**, I want clear directory organization so that I can understand where different types of files belong and follow consistent patterns.

**As a maintainer**, I want archived historical documents so that important information is preserved but doesn't clutter the active workspace.

**As a CI/CD system**, I want properly organized scripts so that build and deployment processes are reliable and maintainable.

## Spec Scope

### Primary Deliverables
- **Clean Root Directory**: Move non-essential files to appropriate subdirectories
- **Scripts Organization**: Centralize all scripts in `/scripts` directory with clear naming
- **Documentation Archive**: Move outdated documentation to `/archive` while keeping active docs accessible
- **Configuration Management**: Organize config files in appropriate locations with clear ownership
- **Directory Structure**: Establish standard directory layout following Node.js/TypeScript best practices

### File Categories to Address
- **Scripts**: PowerShell, batch, shell scripts scattered in root
- **Documentation**: Multiple README variants, migration guides, implementation summaries
- **Configuration**: Various config files for different tools and environments
- **Archives**: Historical documents and deprecated files
- **Development Tools**: Build, test, and deployment configurations

## Out of Scope

- **Code Refactoring**: No changes to actual application logic or architecture
- **Package Structure**: No modifications to package.json dependencies or build outputs
- **Git History**: Preserve all git history during file moves
- **External Dependencies**: No changes to external integrations or APIs
- **Functional Testing**: Repository organization should not affect application functionality

## Expected Deliverable

### Directory Structure
```
automatic-claude-code/
├── src/                          # Application source code (unchanged)
├── dual-agent-monitor/          # Monitoring dashboard (unchanged)
├── scripts/                     # All executable scripts
│   ├── build/                   # Build-related scripts
│   ├── deploy/                  # Deployment scripts
│   ├── dev/                     # Development utilities
│   └── maintenance/             # Cleanup and maintenance scripts
├── docs/                        # Active documentation (enhanced)
├── archive/                     # Historical documents and deprecated files
├── config/                      # Configuration files (if needed)
├── .agent-os/                   # Agent OS files (unchanged)
├── .claude/                     # Claude configuration (unchanged)
├── tests/                       # Test files (unchanged)
└── [essential root files only]  # Package.json, README.md, etc.
```

### Root Directory Cleanup
- **Keep**: package.json, README.md, CHANGELOG.md, LICENSE, .gitignore, tsconfig.json, essential configs
- **Move**: All scripts, migration docs, implementation summaries, duplicate READMEs
- **Archive**: Outdated documentation, deprecated files, old migration guides

### Quality Gates
- Root directory contains <15 files (down from 38+)
- All scripts executable and properly documented
- No broken relative path references after moves
- Documentation is discoverable and well-organized
- CI/CD processes continue to function correctly
