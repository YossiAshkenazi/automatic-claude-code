# Service Modularization - Lite Summary

Break down monolithic files (websocket-server.ts 1000+ lines, index.ts 500+ lines) into focused, maintainable service modules following Single Responsibility Principle.

## Key Points
- **Modular Architecture**: Split large files into 8-12 focused service modules with clear responsibilities
- **Service Layer Pattern**: Implement dedicated classes for monitoring, coordination, data management, and API routing
- **Improved Maintainability**: Enable easier testing, debugging, and feature development through proper separation of concerns
