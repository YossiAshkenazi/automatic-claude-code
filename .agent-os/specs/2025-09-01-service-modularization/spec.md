# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: Service Modularization
> Created: 2025-09-01
> Status: Planning

## Overview

This spec addresses the critical need to refactor large monolithic files in the Automatic Claude Code project, specifically targeting `websocket-server.ts` (1000+ lines) and `index.ts` (500+ lines). The current architecture violates the Single Responsibility Principle and makes the codebase difficult to maintain, test, and scale.

## User Stories

**As a developer**, I want modular service files so that I can easily locate, understand, and modify specific functionality without navigating through massive files.

**As a maintainer**, I want clear separation of concerns so that debugging and testing can be focused on specific modules rather than monolithic structures.

**As a team member**, I want consistent service architecture so that new features can be added predictably and existing code can be refactored safely.

**As a system administrator**, I want better error isolation so that issues in one service module don't cascade through unrelated functionality.

## Spec Scope

- **Primary Target**: Refactor `dual-agent-monitor/server/websocket-server.ts` (1000+ lines) into focused service modules
- **Secondary Target**: Refactor `src/index.ts` (500+ lines) into command handlers and service layers
- **Service Layer Creation**: Implement dedicated service classes for agent coordination, monitoring, and data management
- **Route Modularization**: Extract API routes into focused route modules with clear responsibilities
- **Command Handler Separation**: Split CLI command handling into discrete, testable modules
- **Dependency Injection**: Implement proper dependency injection patterns for service modularity
- **Configuration Management**: Centralize configuration handling across modular services

## Out of Scope

- Complete rewrite of existing functionality (maintain behavioral compatibility)
- Database schema changes or migrations
- Frontend component refactoring (focus on backend services)
- Performance optimization (unless directly related to modular architecture)
- External API integration changes
- Authentication/authorization system modifications

## Expected Deliverable

A modular, maintainable service architecture with:

1. **Modular WebSocket Server**: Break down 1000+ line file into 8-12 focused modules
2. **Structured CLI Layer**: Refactor index.ts into command handlers and orchestration layer
3. **Service Classes**: Dedicated classes for monitoring, coordination, data persistence, and analytics
4. **Route Modules**: API endpoints organized by domain (monitoring, agents, sessions, webhooks)
5. **Comprehensive Tests**: Unit tests for each new service module with high coverage
6. **Documentation**: Architecture diagrams and module interaction documentation
7. **Migration Guide**: Step-by-step guide for transitioning existing deployments
