# Test Coverage Enhancement - Lite Summary

Implement comprehensive testing infrastructure to achieve 80%+ code coverage across the automatic-claude-code project, including unit tests, integration tests, E2E tests, and automated CI/CD integration.

## Key Points
- **Current State**: Limited test coverage with gaps in critical components
- **Target Coverage**: 80%+ overall coverage with 85%+ for core modules
- **Testing Stack**: Jest/Vitest for unit tests, Playwright for E2E, comprehensive mocking
- **CI Integration**: Automated testing pipeline with quality gates and coverage reporting
- **Performance Focus**: Establish testing benchmarks with regression detection
