# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: Test Coverage Enhancement
> Created: 2025-09-01
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Enhance the test coverage across the entire automatic-claude-code project from current levels to 80%+ coverage, implementing comprehensive unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests. This includes establishing robust testing infrastructure, automated coverage reporting, and CI/CD integration for continuous quality assurance.

## User Stories

### As a Developer
- I want comprehensive unit tests so that I can refactor code confidently without breaking existing functionality
- I want integration tests so that I can verify component interactions work correctly
- I want E2E tests so that I can validate complete user workflows function as expected
- I want automated coverage reporting so that I can track testing progress and identify gaps
- I want CI/CD test integration so that all changes are automatically validated before deployment

### As a Project Maintainer
- I want high test coverage so that the codebase is reliable and maintainable
- I want automated test execution so that quality gates are enforced consistently
- I want performance benchmarks so that regressions are detected early
- I want test documentation so that new contributors understand testing patterns

### As a User
- I want reliable software so that my automated development workflows don't fail unexpectedly
- I want fast feedback so that issues are caught during development rather than in production

## Spec Scope

### Core Testing Areas
- **Agent System Testing**: Comprehensive coverage of Manager-Worker coordination, communication protocols, and workflow state management
- **CLI Interface Testing**: Command parsing, option handling, error scenarios, and output formatting
- **Configuration Management**: Config loading, validation, merging, and environment-specific overrides
- **Session Management**: Session persistence, restoration, cleanup, and concurrent session handling
- **Output Parsing**: Response parsing, error detection, JSON/text fallback, and structured data extraction
- **Process Management**: Claude CLI spawning, process lifecycle, error handling, and cleanup
- **Monitoring System**: WebSocket communication, real-time updates, data persistence, and dashboard functionality
- **Docker Integration**: Container builds, multi-stage configurations, and deployment scenarios

### Testing Infrastructure
- **Unit Test Framework**: Jest/Vitest configuration with TypeScript support
- **Integration Test Setup**: API testing, database integration, and service communication
- **E2E Test Framework**: Playwright configuration for full workflow testing
- **Coverage Reporting**: Istanbul/c8 integration with detailed reports and thresholds
- **Mock Systems**: Comprehensive mocking for external dependencies (Claude CLI, file system, network)
- **Test Data Management**: Fixtures, factories, and seed data for consistent testing
- **Performance Testing**: Load testing and benchmarking infrastructure

### CI/CD Integration
- **GitHub Actions Enhancement**: Automated test execution, coverage reporting, and quality gates
- **Pre-commit Hooks**: Local test execution and coverage validation
- **Quality Gates**: Minimum coverage thresholds and test pass requirements
- **Parallel Test Execution**: Optimized CI pipeline with parallel test runners

## Out of Scope

- Manual testing procedures (focus on automated testing)
- Load testing beyond basic performance benchmarks
- Security testing (covered in separate security audit spec)
- Browser compatibility testing for monitoring dashboard (covered in UI specs)
- Third-party service testing (Claude API, external integrations)

## Expected Deliverable

A comprehensive testing suite achieving 80%+ code coverage with:

1. **Complete Unit Test Suite**: 200+ unit tests covering all core modules with 85%+ coverage
2. **Integration Test Framework**: 50+ integration tests validating component interactions with 80%+ coverage
3. **E2E Test Suite**: 20+ end-to-end tests covering critical user workflows with 90%+ coverage
4. **Automated Coverage Reporting**: Detailed HTML/JSON coverage reports with trend analysis
5. **CI/CD Pipeline Integration**: Automated test execution with quality gates and failure notifications
6. **Testing Documentation**: Comprehensive guide for writing, running, and maintaining tests
7. **Performance Benchmarks**: Baseline performance tests with regression detection
