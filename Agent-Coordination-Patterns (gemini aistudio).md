# Agent-Coordination-Patterns.md

## Introduction

This document provides a comprehensive overview of agent coordination patterns for AI systems, with a specific focus on the Manager-Worker architecture. In this model, a Manager Agent is responsible for strategic planning, task decomposition, and coordination, while one or more Worker Agents execute the assigned tasks. This architecture is particularly well-suited for complex, multi-step AI workflows where a separation of concerns leads to more robust and scalable systems.

The patterns and examples provided are geared towards a dual-agent system where communication is facilitated through spawned processes, making this guide highly relevant for implementations using technologies like Node.js for orchestrating AI agents like Claude.

## 1. Coordination Patterns & Strategies

Effective coordination is the cornerstone of any multi-agent system. The choice of coordination pattern dictates how agents interact, share information, and work together to achieve a common goal.

### Sequential vs. Parallel vs. Hybrid Coordination

**Sequential Coordination:**
In a sequential model, tasks are executed in a predefined order, with the output of one agent becoming the input for the next. This is suitable for linear workflows with clear dependencies.

* **Decision Tree:**
  * Does Task B require the completed output of Task A?
    * Yes: Consider Sequential Coordination.
    * No: Parallel or Hybrid might be more efficient.

**Parallel Coordination:**
Parallel coordination involves multiple Worker Agents executing tasks simultaneously. This is ideal for tasks that can be broken down into independent sub-tasks, significantly reducing overall execution time.

* **Decision Tree:**
  * Can the main task be broken down into independent sub-tasks?
    * Yes: Parallel Coordination is a good choice.
    * No: Sequential or Hybrid may be more appropriate.

**Hybrid Coordination:**
A hybrid model combines both sequential and parallel execution. For example, a Manager Agent might dispatch several tasks to be executed in parallel, and once all are complete, a final sequential step could aggregate the results.

* **Decision Tree:**
  * Does your workflow have both independent and dependent tasks?
    * Yes: A Hybrid model will likely be the most effective.

### Event-Driven vs. Polling-Based Communication

**Event-Driven:**
Agents communicate by emitting and listening for events. This is a highly efficient model as it avoids unnecessary network requests and allows for near real-time communication.

**Polling-Based:**
Agents periodically check for updates or new tasks. This can be simpler to implement but is less efficient and can introduce latency.

* **Decision Tree:**
  * Do you require real-time updates and minimal latency?
    * Yes: Event-Driven communication is preferred.
  * Is a slight delay acceptable, and is implementation simplicity a priority?
    * Yes: Polling-based communication could be sufficient.

### State Machine Patterns for Agent Workflows

A state machine is an excellent way to model the lifecycle of a task and the state of an agent. Each agent and task can be in a specific state (e.g., `PENDING`, `IN_PROGRESS`, `COMPLETED`, `FAILED`), and transitions between states are triggered by events.

### Consensus Algorithms for Multi-Agent Decisions

In scenarios with multiple Worker Agents, it may be necessary to reach a consensus on the best approach or result. While complex consensus algorithms like Raft or Paxos are typically used in distributed systems, a simplified voting or scoring mechanism can be implemented for many AI agent use cases.

### Load Balancing Between Multiple Worker Agents

When you have multiple Worker Agents, it's crucial to distribute the workload evenly. Common strategies include:

* **Round Robin:** Distribute tasks to workers in a circular order.
* **Least Connections:** Send the next task to the worker with the fewest active tasks.
* **Capability-Based Routing:** A central coordinator directs tasks to agents with the required skills.

## 2. Communication Protocols

The choice of communication protocol is critical for the performance and reliability of a multi-agent system.

### Message Queuing Patterns

Message queues provide a robust and scalable way for agents to communicate asynchronously.

* **Redis:** A fast, in-memory data store that can be used as a message broker with its Pub/Sub capabilities.
* **RabbitMQ:** A more feature-rich message broker that supports complex routing and message persistence.
* **In-Memory:** For single-machine setups, a simple in-memory queue can be sufficient, but it lacks the durability of external brokers.

### Event Sourcing for Agent Interactions

Event sourcing is a pattern where all changes to an application's state are stored as a sequence of events. This is highly beneficial for AI agent systems as it provides a complete audit trail of all agent interactions, which is invaluable for debugging and understanding agent behavior. Since all interactions are captured as immutable events, the state of any agent can be reliably reproduced at any point in time.

### Command/Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS) for Agents

CQRS is an architectural pattern that separates the model for updating data (commands) from the model for reading data (queries). In a multi-agent system, this can be applied by having the Manager Agent issue commands to the Worker Agents, and the Worker Agents can write their results to a separate data store that is optimized for querying. This separation can improve performance and scalability.

### Publish-Subscribe Patterns for Agent Notifications

The publish-subscribe (pub/sub) pattern is a messaging pattern where senders of messages (publishers) do not programmatically send messages directly to specific receivers (subscribers). Instead, messages are categorized into channels, and subscribers receive all messages for the channels they are subscribed to. This is an excellent pattern for broadcasting updates and notifications between agents.

### Request-Response vs. Fire-and-Forget Messaging

* **Request-Response:** The sender expects a reply to their message. This is suitable for tasks where the Manager Agent needs a direct result from a Worker Agent.
* **Fire-and-Forget:** The sender does not expect a reply. This is useful for notifications or logging where a response is not necessary.

## 3. Failure Mode Recovery

Robust failure recovery mechanisms are essential for building resilient multi-agent systems.

### Circuit Breaker Patterns for Agent Communication

The Circuit Breaker pattern is a design pattern used to detect failures and prevent a failing operation from being continuously retried. If a Worker Agent repeatedly fails to respond or throws errors, the circuit breaker will "trip," and subsequent calls to that agent will fail immediately, preventing the system from being overwhelmed. After a timeout, the circuit breaker will allow a limited number of test requests to pass through, and if they succeed, it will "close" the circuit and resume normal operation.

### Timeout and Retry Strategies with Exponential Backoff

When a request to an agent times out, it's often beneficial to retry the request. However, retrying immediately can exacerbate the problem if the agent is overloaded. Exponential backoff is a strategy where the delay between retries increases exponentially, giving the failing agent time to recover.

### Dead Letter Queues for Failed Agent Messages

If a message cannot be processed by an agent after several retries, it should be moved to a Dead Letter Queue (DLQ). This prevents the message from blocking the main queue and allows for later inspection and manual intervention.

### Graceful Degradation When Agents are Unavailable

If a particular type of Worker Agent is unavailable, the system should be able to degrade gracefully. This might mean providing a default response, or temporarily disabling features that rely on that agent.

### State Recovery After Process Crashes

By using a persistent message queue and event sourcing, you can recover the state of your agents after a crash. When an agent restarts, it can replay the events from the event store to restore its state and resume processing messages from the queue.

## 4. Quality Gate Templates

Quality gates are automated validation criteria that ensure the output of an agent meets certain standards before being passed on to the next stage of a workflow.

### Automated Validation Criteria for Different Task Types

For tasks that generate structured data like JSON, you can use schema validation libraries like Zod or Ajv to ensure the output is in the correct format. For natural language outputs, you can use another AI agent to evaluate the quality of the response based on criteria like clarity, coherence, and relevance.

### Code Review Patterns Using AI Agents

AI agents can be used to automate parts of the code review process. They can be trained to identify common coding errors, suggest improvements, and ensure adherence to coding standards. This frees up human developers to focus on more complex aspects of the review.

### Test Validation Gates Before Task Completion

For tasks that involve generating code, a quality gate can be implemented to run a suite of unit tests against the generated code. The task is only considered complete if all tests pass.

### Security Validation Patterns

AI agents can be used to scan for security vulnerabilities in generated code or outputs. This can include checking for common vulnerabilities like SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and insecure use of APIs. It's also important to validate the inputs to agents to prevent prompt injection attacks.

### Performance Benchmarking Gates

For tasks where performance is critical, you can implement a quality gate that benchmarks the execution time and resource consumption of the agent's output. This helps to ensure that changes to the agent's logic or the underlying models do not introduce performance regressions.

## 5. Real-World Implementation Examples

This section provides practical examples and patterns for implementing a Manager-Worker agent system in a Node.js/TypeScript environment.

### Node.js/TypeScript Implementation Patterns

**Manager Agent (`manager.ts`)**

```typescript
import { spawn } from 'child_process';
import { v4 as uuidv4 } from 'uuid';

interface Task {
  id: string;
  type: string;
  payload: any;
}

const tasks: Task[] = [
  { id: uuidv4(), type: 'DATA_ANALYSIS', payload: { data: '...' } },
  { id: uuidv4(), type: 'REPORT_GENERATION', payload: { analysisId: '...' } },
];

tasks.forEach(task => {
  const worker = spawn('node', ['worker.js']);

  worker.stdout.on('data', (data) => {
    console.log(`Worker stdout: ${data}`);
  });

  worker.stderr.on('data', (data) => {
    console.error(`Worker stderr: ${data}`);
  });

  worker.on('close', (code) => {
    console.log(`Worker process exited with code ${code}`);
  });

  worker.on('error', (err) => {
    console.error('Failed to start subprocess.', err);
  });

  worker.stdin.write(JSON.stringify(task));
  worker.stdin.end();
});
```

**Worker Agent (`worker.ts`)**```typescript
process.stdin.on('data', async (data) => {
  const task = JSON.parse(data.toString());

  try {
    // Simulate processing the task with an AI model
    const result = await processTask(task);
    process.stdout.write(JSON.stringify({ status: 'completed', taskId: task.id, result }));
  } catch (error) {
    const err = error as Error;
    process.stderr.write(JSON.stringify({ status: 'failed', taskId: task.id, error: err.message }));
  } finally {
    process.exit();
  }
});

async function processTask(task: any): Promise<any> {
  // In a real implementation, this would involve calling an AI model (e.g., Claude)
  console.log(`Processing task: ${task.id} of type ${task.type}`);
  // Simulate async work
  await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 1000));
  return { processedData: 'some-result' };
}

```
### Process Spawning and Management

The `child_process` module in Node.js is used to spawn new processes. `spawn` is generally preferred over `exec` for long-running processes as it streams I/O instead of buffering it.

### Inter-process Communication (IPC, WebSockets, HTTP)

*   **IPC:** When using `child_process.fork()`, a built-in IPC channel is available for passing JSON messages between the parent and child processes.
*   **WebSockets:** For more complex scenarios, especially when agents are distributed across multiple machines, WebSockets provide a persistent, bi-directional communication channel.
*   **HTTP:** A standard request-response model can also be used, but it's less efficient for real-time, continuous communication.

### Resource Cleanup and Process Lifecycle Management

It's crucial to handle process termination gracefully to avoid orphaned processes.

```typescript
process.on('SIGINT', () => {
  console.log('Manager process shutting down...');
  // Add logic here to gracefully terminate worker processes
  process.exit();
});
```

### Handling EINVAL, ENOENT, and EACCES Errors in Process Spawning

* **EINVAL (Invalid Argument):** This error typically occurs when the arguments passed to `spawn` are invalid.
* **ENOENT (No such file or directory):** This error means that the command you are trying to execute cannot be found in the system's `PATH`. Ensure that the command is installed and its location is in the `PATH` environment variable. On Windows, if you are trying to run a `.bat` or `.cmd` file, you might need to specify the command as, for example, `jekyll.bat` because `child_process` doesn't automatically resolve it like the command prompt does.
* **EACCES (Permission denied):** This error indicates that you do not have the necessary permissions to execute the file. Ensure the file has execute permissions.

You can catch these errors by listening to the `error` event on the spawned child process object.

### Patterns for Windows vs. Linux Compatibility

* **Paths:** Use the `path` module in Node.js to construct platform-agnostic file paths.
* **Shell Commands:** Be mindful that shell commands can differ between Windows (`cmd.exe`) and Linux (`bash`). When possible, use Node.js APIs instead of shell commands. For commands that must run in a shell, you might need platform-specific logic. The Node.js agent is generally compatible with modern versions of Linux, macOS, and Windows.

### Memory Leak Prevention in Long-Running Agent Processes

* **Event Listeners:** Always remove event listeners when they are no longer needed to prevent memory leaks.
* **Closures:** Be cautious of closures that may retain references to large objects.
* **Timers:** Clear timers (`setInterval`, `setTimeout`) when they are no longer required.
* **Global Variables:** Reduce the use of global variables, as they persist for the entire process lifetime.
* **Heap Snapshots:** Use tools like Chrome DevTools for Node.js to take and analyze heap snapshots to identify memory leaks.

### Connection Pooling for WebSocket-Based Agent Communication

For systems with a large number of agents communicating via WebSockets, it's inefficient to create a new connection for each interaction. A connection pool can be used to manage a set of persistent WebSocket connections that can be reused by multiple agents, reducing the overhead of establishing new connections. Libraries like `websocket-pool` can help with implementing load-balancing and reconnecting logic over multiple WebSocket servers.
