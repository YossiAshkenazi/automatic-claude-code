## Key New Features Documented

### 1. Docker Containerization
- **Multi-stage Dockerfile** with development and production targets
- **Docker Compose** development environment (docker-compose.yml)
- **Production Docker Compose** with all services (docker-compose.prod.yml)
- **Container networking** and volume management
- **Health checks** and service dependencies
- **Resource management** and logging configuration

### 2. Persistent Monitoring Service
- **monitoring-server.js**: Lightweight always-running monitor
- **PM2 integration**: Process management with auto-restart
- **PowerShell scripts**: Windows persistence support
- **Health endpoints**: `/health` and `/api/status` for monitoring
- **Low resource usage**: < 100MB RAM operation
- **Auto-restart capabilities**: Multiple management options

### 3. Enhanced Package Scripts
Over 30 new npm scripts added:
- **docker:** family (build, dev, prod, logs, clean, etc.)
- **monitor:** family (start, pm2, persistent, status, etc.)
- **Service management**: backup, restart, monitoring utilities

### 4. Service Reliability Features
- **Multiple startup options**: Native, PM2, Docker, PowerShell
- **Auto-restart mechanisms**: Process and container level
- **Health monitoring**: Service status and performance tracking
- **Crash recovery**: Automatic recovery from failures
- **Graceful shutdown**: Proper cleanup on termination

## Port Configuration Updates

### Development Mode (Full Features)
- **6011**: Frontend UI (React development server)
- **4001**: Backend API + WebSocket server

### Persistent Mode (Always Running)
- **6007**: Lightweight monitoring dashboard + API

### Docker Mode (Production)
- **6011**: Frontend (mapped from container)
- **4001**: Backend (mapped from container)  
- **5432**: PostgreSQL database
- **6379**: Redis cache

## Breaking Changes Documented

1. **Multiple monitoring options** instead of single port configuration
2. **Docker integration** as new deployment method
3. **Service management options** (native, PM2, Docker, PowerShell)
4. **Extended configuration schema** with Docker and monitoring settings
5. **Container-first development** as optional workflow

## User Impact

### For New Users
