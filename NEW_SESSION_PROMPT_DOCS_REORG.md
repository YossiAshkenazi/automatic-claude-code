# ðŸš€ Continue Documentation Reorganization - Parallel Agent Strategy

Continue organizing the automatic-claude-code documentation using **7 parallel agents** for maximum efficiency.

## Current Status
- **Branch**: dashboard-ui-enhancement  
- **Location**: C:\Users\Dev\automatic-claude-code
- **Progress**: Documentation files moved from root to organized docs/ structure
- **Git Status**: Changes staged, ready to commit

## Completed Work
âœ… Created organized docs/ directory structure with subdirectories:
- setup/ - Installation and setup guides
- architecture/ - System design documentation
- development/ - Development guides and PRDs
- operations/ - Usage and troubleshooting
- testing/ - Test reports and guides
- releases/ - Changelogs and release notes
- reference/ - API docs and references
- migration/ - Version migration guides

âœ… Moved 35+ markdown files from root and docs/ to appropriate subdirectories
âœ… Created docs/INDEX.md as central documentation hub
âœ… Updated README.md with documentation links

## Remaining Tasks

### Launch 7 Parallel Agents Using Task Tool

**Agent 1: Commit Handler**
- Subagent: git-workflow
- Task: Create and push comprehensive commit for documentation reorganization. Include detailed commit message explaining the new structure and benefits. Ensure all moved files are properly tracked with git history preserved.

**Agent 2: Cross-Reference Updater**
- Subagent: general-purpose
- Task: Scan all markdown files in docs/ for broken internal links. Update any references to old file locations (e.g., ../CHANGELOG.md should now be ../docs/releases/CHANGELOG.md). Return list of all updated references.

**Agent 3: CI/CD Configuration Checker**
- Subagent: general-purpose
- Task: Check .github/workflows/, Docker configurations, and any CI/CD files for references to documentation. Update any paths that reference moved documentation files. Verify GitHub Actions still work with new structure.

**Agent 4: Script and Configuration Validator**
- Subagent: validation-gates
- Task: Validate that all npm scripts, Docker volumes, PM2 configs, and other configuration files work with the new documentation structure. Test that documentation is still accessible from all entry points.

**Agent 5: Documentation Link Tester**
- Subagent: test-runner
- Task: Test all documentation links are working. Check that relative paths between documents resolve correctly. Verify no 404s or broken references exist in the new structure.

**Agent 6: Archon Task Updater**
- Subagent: general-purpose
- Task: Update the Archon task (ID: 83ce254d-a59a-446b-a9a3-c7f8f6d18d02) status to "review" with summary of completed work. Check for any related tasks that need updating based on this reorganization.

**Agent 7: Final Documentation Generator**
- Subagent: documentation-manager
- Task: Create a DOCUMENTATION_REORG_SUMMARY.md file documenting what was moved where, why the reorganization was done, and how to navigate the new structure. Place in docs/development/.

## Expected Outcomes
- Clean root directory with only essential files (README.md, CLAUDE.md, package.json, etc.)
- All documentation properly organized and accessible
- No broken links or references
- Git history preserved for all moved files
- CI/CD and configurations updated for new paths
- Complete documentation of the reorganization

## Success Criteria
- `ls *.md` in root shows only README.md and CLAUDE.md
- All documentation accessible via docs/INDEX.md
- No broken links in any markdown files
- All tests and CI/CD workflows pass
- Archon task marked as complete

## Testing Commands
```bash
# Verify structure
find docs -type f -name "*.md" | wc -l  # Should show 40+ files

# Check for broken links
grep -r "\.\..*\.md" docs/  # Check relative paths

# Verify git history preserved
git log --follow docs/releases/CHANGELOG.md  # Should show history

# Test documentation accessibility
cat docs/INDEX.md  # Should display documentation hub
```

Launch all 7 agents simultaneously for parallel execution. Each agent should complete their specific task and return results in <1000 tokens for efficient coordination.
