I need research on \"Developer Experience Best Practices for AI Agent System Development\" focusing on debugging, hot reload, and maintainable architectures.

CONTEXT: Building complex agent systems requires excellent developer tooling, debugging capabilities, and development workflows.

RESEARCH FOCUS AREAS:

1. **Local Development Setup**
   
   - Optimal IDE configurations for agent development
   - Docker Compose setups for local agent testing
   - Database seeding and migration strategies
   - Environment variable management
   - Local webhook testing and tunneling

2. **Debugging Techniques**
   
   - Tracing requests across multiple agent processes
   - Interactive debugging with breakpoints in agent code
   - Log aggregation and searching for agent interactions
   - Visual debugging tools for agent state machines
   - Performance profiling of agent operations

3. **Hot Reload & Development Speed**
   
   - File watching and automatic restart patterns
   - In-memory development databases
   - Mock external services for faster development
   - Incremental builds and caching strategies
   - Development mode optimizations

4. **Error Message Design**
   
   - Making agent system errors actionable and clear
   - Error context preservation across agent boundaries
   - User-friendly error messages for complex failures
   - Error documentation and troubleshooting guides
   - Automated error reporting and aggregation

5. **Code Organization & Architecture**
   
   - Modular agent system architectures
   - Dependency injection patterns for testability
   - Plugin architectures for extensible agent systems
   - Code generation for boilerplate reduction
   - Documentation generation from code

6. **Testing & Quality Assurance**
   
   - Test-driven development for agent systems
   - Continuous integration optimizations
   - Code coverage strategies for agent interactions
   - Linting and code formatting for agent codebases
   - Security scanning and vulnerability detection

7. **Documentation & Knowledge Sharing**
   
   - Auto-generated API documentation for agent interfaces
   - Interactive examples and playgrounds
   - Architecture decision records (ADRs) for agent systems
   - Onboarding guides for new team members
   - Knowledge base maintenance and organization

OUTPUT FORMAT:

- Create a markdown document titled \"Developer-Experience-Agent-Development.md\"
- Include tool recommendations and configurations
- Provide step-by-step setup guides
- Add troubleshooting sections for common development issues
- Include productivity tips and best practices
- Add team collaboration strategies

SPECIFIC DX IMPROVEMENTS TO RESEARCH:

- VSCode extensions and configurations for agent development
- Docker development workflow optimization
- Debugging WebSocket connections in development
- Local testing of process spawning and agent coordination
- Development database setup and seeding
- Hot reload strategies for TypeScript agent systems
