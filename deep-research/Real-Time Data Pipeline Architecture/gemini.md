# Real-Time-Data-Pipeline-Architecture.md

This document outlines a robust, scalable, and reliable real-time data pipeline architecture for an AI Agent Monitoring System. It focuses on a hybrid approach leveraging WebSockets for real-time communication to a dashboard and REST APIs for data persistence and external integrations, tailored for a dual-agent (Manager/Worker) system.

---

## 🏛️ Core Architecture: WebSocket + REST Hybrid

The core of this architecture separates the real-time data path from the transactional data path.

* **Real-Time Path (WebSockets):** AI agents (especially Workers) stream high-frequency coordination data, logs, and status updates directly to a WebSocket gateway. This data is immediately published to a message bus (like Kafka or Redis) and consumed by services that push it to the connected React dashboard clients. This path is optimized for low latency.
* **Transactional Path (REST):** Agents (especially Managers) use REST APIs for actions that require persistence, validation, and transactional integrity, such as creating new tasks, updating configurations, or retrieving historical data. These APIs handle the standard Create, Read, Update, Delete (CRUD) operations with the primary database.

## 1. Event Streaming Architecture

This section covers the real-time data flow from agents to the dashboard.

### WebSocket vs. Server-Sent Events (SSE) vs. Long Polling

* **WebSockets:** The best choice for this use case. They provide a **persistent, bidirectional** connection, allowing the server to push data instantly and the client to send messages back on the same channel. Ideal for the chatty, low-latency needs of agent monitoring.
* **Server-Sent Events (SSE):** A simpler, **unidirectional** (server-to-client) protocol over standard HTTP. It's a good alternative if clients only *receive* updates and never send data back. It offers automatic reconnection, which is a plus, but lacks the bidirectional capability of WebSockets.
* **Long Polling:** A legacy technique where the client makes a request and the server holds it open until there's data to send. It's inefficient, creates high overhead, and doesn't scale well compared to WebSockets.

**Verdict:** **WebSockets** are the superior choice for a truly interactive and responsive agent monitoring system.

### Message Serialization Patterns

The format of data sent over the wire is critical for performance.

* **JSON:** Human-readable and universally supported. It's the default choice for web applications but can be verbose, leading to higher bandwidth usage.
* **MessagePack:** "JSON, but fast and small." It's a binary serialization format that is more compact and faster to parse than JSON. A great drop-in improvement for performance-sensitive applications.
* **Protocol Buffers (Protobuf):** A language-agnostic binary format from Google. It requires a predefined schema, which enforces data consistency and provides excellent performance (very small payload size, very fast serialization/deserialization). It's the most robust option but adds the overhead of managing schemas.

**Recommendation:** Start with **JSON** for simplicity. If payload size or serialization latency becomes a bottleneck, migrate to **MessagePack** or **Protobuf**.

### Event Ordering and Delivery Guarantees

* **Ordering:** In a distributed system, guaranteeing that messages are processed in the exact order they were sent is challenging.
    * **Kafka:** Provides ordering guarantees **within a partition**. You can ensure all events from a single agent `(agent_id)` go to the same partition by using the `agent_id` as the partition key. This guarantees that events *from that specific agent* are processed in order.
    * **Redis Streams:** Also offers strong ordering guarantees.
* **Delivery Guarantees:**
    * **At-most-once:** Messages may be lost but are never redelivered. (Fast but unreliable).
    * **At-least-once:** Messages are never lost but may be redelivered. This requires consumers to be idempotent. (Good for most use cases).
    * **Exactly-once:** Every message is delivered and processed once. (Complex and high-overhead, often achieved with transactional producers/consumers).

**Recommendation:** Use **Kafka** with `agent_id` as the partition key to achieve per-agent event ordering and configure it for an **at-least-once** delivery guarantee.

### Pub/Sub Patterns

A message broker is essential to decouple the WebSocket gateway from the consumers (e.g., push services, analytics pipelines).

* **Redis Pub/Sub:** Extremely fast and simple. It's a "fire and forget" model—if no subscribers are listening, the message is lost. Good for transient, non-critical notifications.
* **Redis Streams:** A more robust data structure within Redis that provides persistence, consumer groups, and message acknowledgements. A lightweight but powerful alternative to Kafka.
* **Apache Kafka:** The industry standard for high-throughput, persistent event streaming. It's designed for durability and massive scale. It's more complex to set up and manage but is the best choice for a system with a high volume of critical events that need to be audited or replayed.
* **In-Memory Solutions:** (e.g., Node.js `EventEmitter`). Only suitable for single-server, non-scalable applications. **Avoid for production systems.**

**Recommendation:** For a serious monitoring system, **Apache Kafka** is the superior choice due to its durability and scalability. **Redis Streams** is a viable, simpler alternative if the scale is moderate.

### Event Sourcing

Event sourcing is a pattern where all changes to the application state are stored as a sequence of events.

* **How it works:** Instead of updating a record in a database, you append an event like `AgentStateChanged` or `TaskCompleted` to an event log (Kafka is perfect for this). The current state of an agent can be derived by replaying its events.
* **Benefits:**
    * **Complete Audit Trail:** You have an immutable log of everything that ever happened.
    * **Time Travel:** You can reconstruct the state of the system at any point in time.
    * **Debugging:** Makes it much easier to diagnose issues by examining the sequence of events.

**Implementation:** The REST API handles a command (e.g., `POST /tasks`), validates it, and then publishes an event (e.g., `TaskCreated`) to Kafka. A separate consumer service listens to this topic, processes the event, and updates a materialized view in the main PostgreSQL database for fast querying.

---

## 2. Data Consistency & Reliability

Ensuring data is correct and trustworthy, especially in a distributed real-time system.

### ACID vs. Eventual Consistency

* **ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability):** These are the traditional properties of a relational database transaction. In our architecture, the **REST API path interacting with PostgreSQL** should enforce ACID properties for critical operations (e.g., creating a billing record, registering a new agent).
* **Eventual Consistency:** The real-time dashboard data can be eventually consistent. It's acceptable if the dashboard view is a few milliseconds behind the true state. The data streamed through the WebSocket path will eventually reflect the state persisted via the REST path. This is a standard trade-off for performance in distributed systems.

### Conflict Resolution

Conflicts can arise when, for example, a user updates an agent's setting via the dashboard (WebSocket message) at the same time an automated process updates it via the REST API.

* **Last-Write-Wins (LWW):** The simplest strategy. The last update received, based on a timestamp, overwrites previous ones. This is often sufficient but can lead to lost data.
* **Optimistic Locking:** When fetching data, the client also gets a version number. When sending an update, it includes this version number. The server rejects the update if the current version on the server is different, forcing the client to refetch and retry. This is a robust pattern for the **REST API**.
* **Operational Transformation (OT):** A more complex algorithm used in collaborative editing tools like Google Docs. Likely overkill for this monitoring system unless you have multiple managers co-editing agent configurations in real-time.

### Data Deduplication & Idempotent API Design

* **Deduplication:** Agents might send the same event twice due to network retries. Each event should have a unique ID (`event_id`). The consumer service can keep a short-term cache (e.g., in Redis) of recently processed `event_id`s and discard duplicates.
* **Idempotency:** An operation is idempotent if making the same request multiple times has the same effect as making it once. This is crucial for reliability. For the REST API, this is often achieved by requiring a unique request identifier (e.g., `Idempotency-Key` in the HTTP header) for `POST` or `PATCH` requests. The server stores the result of the first request and returns the cached response for subsequent retries with the same key.

```typescript
// Node.js/Express middleware for idempotency
import { NextFunction, Request, Response } from 'express';
import { redisClient } from './redis';

const processedRequests = new Set<string>();

export const idempotencyCheck = async (req: Request, res: Response, next: NextFunction) => {
  const idempotencyKey = req.headers['idempotency-key'] as string;

  if (!idempotencyKey) {
    return next(); // No key, proceed as normal
  }

  const isProcessed = await redisClient.get(`idempotency:${idempotencyKey}`);

  if (isProcessed) {
    console.log(`Duplicate request detected: ${idempotencyKey}`);
    // Potentially return a cached response or a specific status code
    return res.status(409).json({ message: 'Request already processed' });
  }

  // Store the key with a TTL to prevent memory leaks
  await redisClient.set(`idempotency:${idempotencyKey}`, 'processed', { EX: 3600 }); // 1 hour TTL

  next();
};
````

## 3. Session Management Patterns

Handling user and agent connections effectively.

### Persistent vs. In-Memory Session Storage

- **In-Memory:** Storing session data on the WebSocket server instance itself.
    
    - **Pros:** Extremely fast access.
        
    - **Cons:** Fails if the server instance crashes. Doesn't work when you scale horizontally to multiple servers.
        
- **Persistent (e.g., Redis, Memcached):** Storing session data in a centralized, fast data store.
    
    - **Pros:** Sessions survive server restarts. Any server instance can handle a request for any session. Enables horizontal scaling.
        
    - **Cons:** Slightly higher latency than in-memory. Adds a dependency.
        

**Recommendation:** Use **Redis** for session storage. It's the industry standard for scalable web applications.

### Session Stickiness vs. Stateless Design

- **Session Stickiness (Stateful):** A load balancer is configured to always route a user to the same server instance where their session was created. This can simplify things initially but makes scaling and failover more difficult. If that server goes down, the session is lost.
    
- **Stateless Design:** Each server instance can handle any user at any time because the session state is stored centrally (in Redis). This is far more resilient and scalable.
    

**Recommendation:** Design the WebSocket servers to be **stateless**. The user's session ID (retrieved from a cookie or JWT) is used to fetch their session data from Redis on connection.

### WebSocket Connection Recovery

Network blips happen. The client needs to handle disconnections gracefully.

1. **Client-side Detection:** The client should use the WebSocket `onclose` event to detect a lost connection.
    
2. **Exponential Backoff:** The client should attempt to reconnect automatically, using an exponential backoff strategy (e.g., wait 1s, then 2s, 4s, 8s) to avoid overwhelming the server.
    
3. **State Restoration:** When the client reconnects, it might have missed messages. A common pattern is for the client to send the timestamp or ID of the last message it received. The server can then query the persisted data (or an event log) to send the client a "catch-up" payload of what it missed before resuming the real-time stream.
    

---

## 4. Backpressure & Flow Control

What happens when data producers (agents) are faster than consumers (database, dashboard)? 🌊

### Rate Limiting Patterns

Prevent individual agents from overwhelming the system.

- **Token Bucket Algorithm:** Each agent has a "bucket" of tokens that refills at a constant rate. Each event sent requires one token. If the bucket is empty, the event is rejected or queued. This is a flexible algorithm that allows for bursts of traffic. It can be implemented efficiently using Redis.
    

### Circuit Breaker Patterns

Protect the system from failing or overwhelmed downstream services (e.g., a slow database).

- **How it works:** A "circuit breaker" object wraps calls to a service. It tracks failures.
    
    1. **Closed:** Requests pass through normally. If failures exceed a threshold, it "trips".
        
    2. **Open:** All requests to the service fail immediately for a set timeout period, without even attempting the call. This gives the downstream service time to recover.
        
    3. **Half-Open:** After the timeout, it allows a single request through. If it succeeds, the circuit closes. If it fails, it opens again.
        

### Buffering Strategies

When data comes in too fast, you can buffer it.

- **Queues:** A simple FIFO (First-In, First-Out) queue. If the queue grows too large, you risk running out of memory.
    
- **Ring Buffers:** A fixed-size circular buffer. When it's full, new data overwrites the oldest data. This is great for non-critical logs or metrics where losing the oldest data is acceptable.
    
- **Dropping Policies:** If buffering isn't an option, you might have to drop data.
    
    - **Tail Drop:** Drop the newest incoming messages (simplest).
        
    - **Head Drop:** Drop the oldest messages in the queue (better for real-time data).
        
    - **Random Drop:** Drop messages randomly.
        

### Adaptive Batching

Instead of writing every single event to the database as it arrives, group them into batches.

- **Adaptive Logic:** The size of the batch and the flush interval can be adjusted based on system load.
    
    - _Low Load:_ Use small batches and frequent flushes for low latency.
        
    - _High Load:_ Use larger batches and less frequent flushes to increase throughput and reduce load on the database.

## 5. Scalability Patterns

Designing the system to handle growth.

### Horizontal Scaling of WebSocket Servers

A single WebSocket server can handle a large number of concurrent connections (tens of thousands), but you'll eventually need more.

- **The Challenge:** A user's WebSocket connection is tied to a specific server instance. How does Server A send a message to a user connected to Server B?
    
- **The Solution: A Backplane.** All WebSocket servers connect to a central Pub/Sub system (like Redis or Kafka). When a message needs to be broadcast, a server publishes it to a channel on the backplane. All other servers are subscribed to that channel, receive the message, and forward it to their connected clients.
    

### Database Sharding

For massive scale, a single database can become a bottleneck. Sharding involves splitting your data across multiple database instances.

- **Sharding Strategy:** A common strategy is to shard by `tenant_id` or `agent_id`. All data for a given agent resides on the same shard. This keeps queries for a single agent efficient.
    
- **Complexity:** Sharding adds significant operational complexity. It should only be considered when you're hitting the limits of a single large, vertically-scaled database instance. For time-series data, the partitioning features of TimescaleDB often delay the need for manual sharding for a very long time.
    

### Caching Layers

Reduce database load by caching frequently accessed data.

- **Redis/Memcached:** Great for caching session data, agent configurations, or the results of expensive queries.
    
- **Application-Level Cache:** An in-memory cache within the REST API service (e.g., a simple LRU cache). Useful for data that is extremely hot but can tolerate slight staleness.
    
- **CDN for Static Assets:** Use a Content Delivery Network (e.g., Cloudflare, AWS CloudFront) to serve the React dashboard's static files (JS, CSS, images). This dramatically reduces latency for users globally and offloads traffic from your servers.
    

### Load Balancer Configuration for WebSockets

- WebSocket connections are long-lived, unlike HTTP requests. The load balancer must support this.
    
- Use a modern L7 (Application Layer) load balancer like Nginx, HAProxy, or cloud providers' offerings (AWS ALB, Google Cloud Load Balancing).
    
- **Enable Sticky Sessions? NO.** As discussed in section 3, a stateless server design is better. The load balancer can use a simple round-robin or least-connections algorithm.
    
- **Health Checks:** The load balancer needs to periodically check the health of the WebSocket servers to route traffic away from failing instances.

## 6. Integration Patterns

Connecting your system to the outside world.

### Webhook Delivery and Retry Logic

When an event occurs (e.g., an agent completes a critical task), you may need to notify an external system via a webhook.

- **Problem:** The external system might be down or return an error. A simple "fire and forget" HTTP request is not reliable enough.
    
- **Solution:** Use a persistent job queue (e.g., **BullMQ** with Redis, or AWS SQS).
    
    1. When a webhook needs to be sent, add a job to the queue instead of sending the request directly.
        
    2. A separate pool of workers processes jobs from the queue.
        
    3. If a delivery fails, the job can be re-queued with an **exponential backoff** delay.
        
    4. After several failed attempts, the job can be moved to a **dead-letter queue (DLQ)** for manual inspection.
        

TypeScript

```
// Node.js/TypeScript example with BullMQ for reliable webhooks
import { Queue, Worker } from 'bullmq';
import axios from 'axios';

const webhookQueue = new Queue('webhook-delivery', { connection: redisClient });

// Function to add a job to the queue
export const scheduleWebhook = async (url: string, payload: any) => {
  await webhookQueue.add('send-webhook', { url, payload }, {
    attempts: 5, // Try up to 5 times
    backoff: {
      type: 'exponential',
      delay: 1000, // 1s, 2s, 4s, 8s, 16s
    },
  });
};

// Worker to process the jobs
new Worker('webhook-delivery', async (job) => {
  const { url, payload } = job.data;
  console.log(`Attempting to send webhook to ${url}`);
  try {
    await axios.post(url, payload);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(`Webhook to ${url} failed. Attempt ${job.attemptsMade}`);
    throw error; // Throwing error tells BullMQ to retry
  }
}, { connection: redisClient });
```

### Stream Processing

Instead of just pushing events to the dashboard, you can perform real-time analysis on the event stream from Kafka.

- **Use Cases:**
    
    - Real-time anomaly detection (e.g., an agent's memory usage suddenly spikes).
        
    - Generating real-time metrics (e.g., average task completion time over the last 5 minutes).
        
    - Filtering and routing events to different systems.
        
- **Tools:**
    
    - **Kafka Streams:** A client library for building stream processing applications.
        
    - **Apache Flink:** A powerful, dedicated stream processing framework.
        
    - **ksqlDB:** A streaming database that lets you run SQL-like queries on your Kafka topics.

## 🔧 Specific Implementation Needs

### PostgreSQL Real-Time Features (NOTIFY/LISTEN)

This is a powerful pattern to have database changes trigger real-time updates without constant polling.

- **Scenario:** A Manager agent updates an agent's configuration via the REST API. This `UPDATE` query in PostgreSQL should trigger a WebSocket push to the relevant dashboard.
    
- **Mechanism:**
    
    1. Create a PostgreSQL function/trigger that runs after an `INSERT` or `UPDATE` on a specific table.
        
    2. This trigger calls `pg_notify()` with a channel name (e.g., `'agent_updated'`) and a JSON payload containing the new data.
        
    3. A dedicated Node.js service (or the WebSocket gateway itself) uses a `pg` client to `LISTEN` on that channel.
        
    4. When it receives a notification, it pushes the data to the correct clients via WebSocket.
        

TypeScript

```
// PostgreSQL Trigger Function
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION agent_config_notify()
RETURNS TRIGGER AS $$
BEGIN
  PERFORM pg_notify(
    'agent_updates',
    json_build_object(
      'id', NEW.id,
      'new_config', NEW.config
    )::text
  );
  RETURN NEW;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;

CREATE TRIGGER agent_config_trigger
AFTER UPDATE ON agent_configs
FOR EACH ROW EXECUTE FUNCTION agent_config_notify();

// Node.js Listener Service
import { Client } from 'pg';

const client = new Client({ /* connection details */ });

async function setupListener() {
  await client.connect();
  await client.query('LISTEN agent_updates');
  console.log('Listening for agent_updates notifications...');

  client.on('notification', (msg) => {
    console.log('Received notification:', msg.payload);
    const data = JSON.parse(msg.payload);
    // Logic to find the right WebSocket client and send the data
    // webSocketServer.sendToClient(data.id, data);
  });
}

setupListener();
```

### React State Management for Real-Time Data (Zustand)

Zustand is a minimalist state management library for React. It's an excellent choice for handling real-time data streams.

TypeScript

```
// Zustand store in a React app (stores/agentStore.ts)
import create from 'zustand';
import { io, Socket } from 'socket.io-client';

interface AgentState {
  agents: Record<string, any>; // A map of agentId -> agentData
  socket: Socket | null;
  connect: () => void;
  disconnect: () => void;
}

export const useAgentStore = create<AgentState>((set, get) => ({
  agents: {},
  socket: null,
  connect: () => {
    console.log('Connecting to WebSocket...');
    const socket = io('ws://your-server-url');

    socket.on('connect', () => {
      console.log('Connected!');
      set({ socket });
    });

    // Listen for a full state sync on connect
    socket.on('initial-state', (initialAgents) => {
      set({ agents: initialAgents });
    });

    // Listen for incremental updates
    socket.on('agent-update', (updatedAgent) => {
      set((state) => ({
        agents: { ...state.agents, [updatedAgent.id]: updatedAgent },
      }));
    });

    socket.on('disconnect', () => {
      console.log('Disconnected.');
      set({ socket: null });
    });
  },
  disconnect: () => {
    get().socket?.disconnect();
    set({ socket: null });
  },
}));

// In a React component
import { useEffect } from 'react';
import { useAgentStore } from './stores/agentStore';

function AgentDashboard() {
  const { agents, connect, disconnect } = useAgentStore();

  useEffect(() => {
    connect();
    return () => disconnect(); // Disconnect on component unmount
  }, [connect, disconnect]);

  return (
    <div>
      {Object.values(agents).map(agent => (
        <div key={agent.id}>{agent.name}: {agent.status}</div>
      ))}
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Time-Series Data Storage and Querying

Agent monitoring data (CPU, memory, logs) is time-series data.

- **Database Choice:** While standard PostgreSQL can handle this, **TimescaleDB** (a PostgreSQL extension) is purpose-built for it. It provides automatic partitioning by time ("hypertables"), significantly improving ingestion and query performance. It also includes functions for time-series analysis (e.g., `time_bucket`, `first`, `last`).
    
- **Schema Example:**
    
    SQL
    
    ```
    CREATE TABLE agent_metrics (
      time        TIMESTAMPTZ       NOT NULL,
      agent_id    UUID              NOT NULL,
      cpu_usage   DOUBLE PRECISION  NOT NULL,
      memory_usageBIGINT            NOT NULL,
      PRIMARY KEY (agent_id, time)
    );
    
    -- Convert to a TimescaleDB hypertable
    SELECT create_hypertable('agent_metrics', 'time');
    ```
    
- **Querying:**
    
    SQL
    
    ```
    -- Get 15-minute average CPU usage for a specific agent today
    SELECT
      time_bucket('15 minutes', time) AS fifteen_min,
      AVG(cpu_usage)
    FROM agent_metrics
    WHERE agent_id = '...' AND time > NOW() - INTERVAL '1 day'
    GROUP BY fifteen_min
    ORDER BY fifteen_min;
    ```
    

### Cross-Origin WebSocket Security

By default, browsers block cross-origin WebSocket connections.

- **CORS is not the (whole) answer:** CORS headers are used for HTTP requests. The WebSocket connection _starts_ with an HTTP `Upgrade` request, so your server must handle CORS for this initial handshake.
    
- **Origin Check:** The most important security measure. When a connection is established, your WebSocket server **must** check the `Origin` header of the incoming request and reject any connection that is not from your allowed list of domains.
    

TypeScript

```
// Node.js 'ws' library example for origin check
import { WebSocketServer } from 'ws';

const wss = new WebSocketServer({
  port: 8080,
  verifyClient: (info, done) => {
    const allowedOrigins = ['http://localhost:3000', '[https://your-dashboard.com](https://your-dashboard.com)'];
    const origin = info.origin;

    if (allowedOrigins.includes(origin)) {
      console.log(`Connection from allowed origin: ${origin}`);
      done(true);
    } else {
      console.error(`Rejected connection from origin: ${origin}`);
      done(false, 403, 'Forbidden');
    }
  },
});
```

- **Authentication:** Don't rely on the origin check alone. The client should send a token (e.g., a JWT) as a query parameter during the connection request (`ws://your-server.com?token=...`). The server validates this token before fully establishing the connection.

## 📊 Performance, Monitoring & Cost

### Performance Benchmarks & Capacity Planning

- **Key Metrics:**
    
    - **Latency:** Time from event generation to dashboard update.
        
    - **Throughput:** Messages processed per second.
        
    - **Concurrent Connections:** Number of active clients per WebSocket server instance.
        
- **Capacity Planning:**
    
    1. **Estimate:** Calculate expected load (e.g., 1000 agents * 5 events/sec = 5000 events/sec).
        
    2. **Load Test:** Use tools like `k6` (with its WebSocket support) or `Thor` to simulate agent connections and message volume against a staging environment.
        
    3. **Extrapolate:** Determine the capacity of a single server instance (e.g., one server handles 10k connections and 20k msg/sec). Plan your production cluster size based on these numbers, adding a buffer (e.g., 50%) for spikes.
        

### Monitoring & Alerting Strategies

You can't fix what you can't see.

- **Application Metrics (Prometheus/Grafana):**
    
    - WebSocket Server: Active connections, messages in/out per second, memory/CPU usage.
        
    - Kafka: Consumer lag (critical!), topic sizes, broker health.
        
    - REST API: Request rate, error rate (5xx), request latency (p95, p99).
        
- **Logging (ELK Stack/Datadog/Loki):** Centralized, structured logging is essential for debugging. Log key events like connection established, agent authentication failed, message published to Kafka, etc.
    
- **Alerting (Alertmanager/PagerDuty):**
    
    - **High Priority:** Kafka consumer lag > threshold (means real-time data is delayed!), 5xx error rate > 5%, service is down.
        
    - **Low Priority:** CPU usage > 80% for 10 minutes, disk space running low on DB.
        

### Cost Analysis

Costs will vary wildly based on cloud provider and scale.

| Component             | Cheaper Option (Low-Medium Scale)                  | More Expensive Option (High Scale & Managed)                  | Cost Drivers                                     |
| --------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| **WebSocket Servers** | Self-hosted on EC2/DigitalOcean Droplets (Node.js) | Managed service like AWS App Runner, or serverless WebSockets | CPU, Memory, Concurrent Connections, Data Egress |
| **Pub/Sub System**    | Self-hosted Redis/Kafka on EC2                     | Managed Kafka (Confluent Cloud, AWS MSK, Aiven)               | Message throughput, Data retention               |
| **Database**          | Self-hosted PostgreSQL + TimescaleDB on EC2        | Managed DB (AWS RDS, Timescale Cloud)                         | Storage, CPU/IOPS, High Availability features    |
| **Webhook Queue**     | Self-hosted BullMQ on Redis instance               | AWS SQS                                                       | Number of jobs processed                         |

**General Principle:** Managed services have a higher direct cost but significantly reduce operational overhead, which is often a worthwhile trade-off. Start small and simple, and scale up components as bottlenecks appear.
