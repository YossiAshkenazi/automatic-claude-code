- **Dependency Reduction**: Elimination of 7 major dependencies (node-pty, ws, complex browser libs)
- **Test Simplification**: Estimated 15 test files using SDK mocking patterns
- **Configuration Streamlining**: 3 core configuration paths (SDK auth, dual-agent options, logging)

#### Implementation Timeline & Technical Phases

**Phase-Gate Technical Architecture:**
1. **Foundation Phase** (Week 1-2): Enhanced SDK executor with comprehensive browser compatibility testing
2. **Execution Engine Phase** (Week 3-4): SDK-only autopilot engine with task completion analysis
3. **Coordination Phase** (Week 5-6): Direct SDK dual-agent coordination replacing PTY communication
4. **Legacy Elimination Phase** (Week 7-8): PTY removal with configuration migration and testing

## User Interface Design Goals

### Overall UX Vision

**Developer-First Command Line Experience**: Maintain the existing terminal-native interface that developers expect from professional tooling, with consistent output formatting, progress indicators, and error messaging that integrates seamlessly into development workflows. The CLI should feel like a natural extension of existing development tools (git, npm, docker) with predictable behavior and clear status communication.

**Simplified Architecture Transparency**: Users should experience improved reliability and faster response times through the SDK-only architecture while remaining completely unaware of the underlying technical transformation. The interface should preserve all current command patterns while delivering enhanced performance through eliminated PTY complexity.

### Key Interaction Paradigms

**Command-Line Native Interface**: 
- Preserve existing `acc` command structure with all current flags and options
- Maintain familiar terminal output patterns with colorized status indicators
- Support pipeline-friendly output modes for integration with CI/CD workflows
- Provide progress indicators for long-running operations without breaking terminal flow

**Dual-Agent Coordination Visibility**:
- Clear indication of Manager vs Worker agent activity through terminal output
- Progress tracking for multi-step operations with agent coordination status  
- Error reporting that distinguishes between SDK, coordination, and task-level failures
- Optional verbose mode showing detailed agent communication for debugging

**Session Management Interface**:
- Consistent session logging and recovery mechanisms preserving current patterns
- Clear session boundary indicators for audit and debugging purposes
- Simplified session configuration through streamlined command options
- Hook script integration maintains existing event payload formats for external tools

### Core Screens and Views

**Primary CLI Interface**:
- Standard `acc run "task"` execution with real-time progress display
- Dual-agent mode activation through `--dual-agent` flag maintaining current UX
- Configuration management through `acc config` commands preserving existing patterns
- Session history and recovery through `acc history` and `acc recover` commands

**Monitoring Dashboard (Optional)**:
- Web-based monitoring interface accessible at http://localhost:6011 when enabled

**Professional Developer Tooling Aesthetic**: 
- Consistent with established CLI tool design patterns (clean, informative, non-intrusive)
- Color scheme aligned with terminal color standards for status indication (green=success, yellow=warning, red=error)
- Output formatting designed for both human readability and machine parsing
- Minimal branding elements focused on functional clarity over visual identity

### Target Platforms: Cross-Platform CLI

**Supported Environments**:
- **Windows**: PowerShell and Command Prompt with full feature parity
- **macOS**: Terminal.app, iTerm2, and other standard terminal applications  
- **Linux**: All standard terminal emulators with bash/zsh compatibility
- **Docker**: Containerized deployment maintaining cross-platform consistency

**Platform-Specific Considerations**:
- Windows: PowerShell execution policy handling and path resolution
- macOS: Keychain integration for browser authentication when available
- Linux: Package manager integration and standard directory conventions
- Container: Volume mounting for configuration and session persistence
