# Automatic Claude Code v2.2.0 Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Goals and Background Context

### Goals
- Enable enterprise-scale agent coordination through WebSocket connection pooling
- Provide real-time performance analytics and monitoring insights
- Simplify Kubernetes deployment for production environments
- Enhance BMAD integration for advanced agent orchestration
- Implement AI-powered code review and suggestion capabilities
- Improve developer experience with auto-configuration and smart defaults
- Reduce operational overhead through self-healing and auto-recovery mechanisms

### Background Context
Following the successful v2.1.0 release which established a solid SDK-only architecture with comprehensive documentation and security enhancements, v2.2.0 focuses on scaling capabilities and operational excellence. The current system handles single-agent and dual-agent modes effectively with a 69.3% quality score, but enterprise users require more sophisticated coordination capabilities, better observability, and production-ready deployment options. This release addresses the growing demand for managing multiple concurrent agent sessions, providing actionable insights from monitoring data, and simplifying cloud-native deployments.

The market is moving toward AI-powered development workflows where multiple specialized agents collaborate on complex tasks. Our users have expressed strong interest in better visibility into agent decision-making, performance bottlenecks, and coordination patterns. Additionally, the need for Kubernetes deployment reflects the enterprise adoption trajectory of the platform.
