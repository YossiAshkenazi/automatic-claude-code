# ACC SDK Testing Infrastructure Fix - Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Goals and Background Context

### Goals
â€¢ **Process Termination**: SDK tests complete cleanly without requiring Ctrl+C intervention
â€¢ **Session Management**: Eliminate nested session detection warnings and improper fallbacks  
â€¢ **Test Reliability**: Ensure all SDK component tests run successfully and consistently
â€¢ **Developer Experience**: Provide fast, reliable testing workflow for continuous development
â€¢ **Process Isolation**: Each test runs independently without interfering with other processes
â€¢ **Comprehensive Coverage**: All SDK components (executor, autopilot, session manager) properly tested

### Background Context

The Automatic Claude Code (ACC) project's SDK testing infrastructure is experiencing critical reliability issues that impair developer productivity and deployment confidence. The current test suite exhibits process hanging behavior, improper session handling, and architectural inconsistencies that suggest fundamental issues in the SDK integration layer.

These problems prevent reliable continuous integration, create friction in the development workflow, and risk production deployment stability. The ACC project, being a TypeScript CLI tool for AI-assisted development automation, requires robust testing infrastructure to maintain its core value proposition of reliable, automated development assistance.

### ðŸŽ¯ Critical Implementation Sequence

**Based on dependency analysis, the required implementation order is:**

1. **PHASE 1: Foundation** - Fix TypeScript compilation (FR6) + SDK availability detection (FR7)
2. **PHASE 2: Core Issue** - Resolve SDK session detection logic (FR2)  
3. **PHASE 3: Isolation** - Implement proper process isolation (FR8)
4. **PHASE 4: Completion** - Ensure clean termination (FR1)
5. **PHASE 5: Validation** - Validate all component tests pass (FR3, FR4, FR5)

**Root Cause Identified:** The "nested session detection" warning is the core blocker causing cascading failures in process management and test reliability.

## Technical Assumptions

### Repository Structure: **Monorepo**
*Rationale: The ACC project uses a single repository with multiple components (CLI, dual-agent-monitor, SDK integration)*

### Service Architecture: **Hybrid SDK Integration Architecture**
*CRITICAL DECISION: The ACC system integrates with the external @anthropic-ai/claude-code SDK while maintaining its own execution engine. Testing infrastructure must accommodate both direct SDK calls and wrapped execution patterns.*

### Testing Requirements: **Enhanced Testing Pyramid with SDK-Specific Isolation**
*CRITICAL DECISION: Standard Jest testing enhanced with:*
- SDK session isolation mechanisms to prevent nested session detection
- Process-level test isolation for clean termination
- Cross-platform process management testing
- Health check automation for CI/CD integration

### Additional Technical Assumptions and Requests

**Language & Framework Constraints:**
- **TypeScript 5.3+** - Current codebase standard, must maintain compatibility
- **Node.js 18+** - Engine requirement from package.json
- **Jest 29.7+** - Existing test framework, needs enhanced configuration

**SDK Integration Constraints:**
- **@anthropic-ai/claude-code SDK** - External dependency, version pinning required for stability
- **Session Detection Override** - Must implement mechanism to bypass SDK session detection during testing
- **Direct Import Strategy** - Current codebase uses direct SDK import, testing must respect this pattern

**Process Management Requirements:**
- **Clean Event Loop Management** - All tests must properly clean up event loop handles
- **Cross-Platform Process Handling** - Must work identically on Windows, macOS, Linux
- **Background Process Isolation** - Test processes must not interfere with development sessions

**CI/CD Integration Requirements:**
- **Health Check Automation** - Existing health-check.js must be integrated into CI pipeline
- **Timeout Management** - All tests must respect CI timeout constraints (60 seconds total)
- **Resource Limits** - Memory usage must be monitored and capped for CI environments
