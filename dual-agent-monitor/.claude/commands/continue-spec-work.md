# Continue Specification Implementation Work

## Overview
This command continues systematic implementation of unfinished specifications for the Countywide Homes Property Management System using the proven multi-agent approach that successfully completed the Mobile Frontend Rebuild.

## Pre-Step: Spec Selection

Before proceeding, I need to analyze the unfinished specifications and present you with options:

**Please execute this analysis first:**

1. Search through `.agent-os/specs/` directory for all specification folders
2. Identify specs with status "Not Implemented", "0% complete", or similar incomplete status
3. Exclude the completed Mobile Frontend Rebuild spec (`2025-08-27-mobile-frontend-rebuild`)
4. Present a numbered list of available specs with:
   - Spec name and priority level
   - Brief description of what it implements
   - Current completion status
   - Estimated complexity/timeline

**Example expected format:**
```
Available Unfinished Specifications:

1. **MFA Implementation** (High Priority - Security Enhancement)
   - Location: `.agent-os/specs/2025-08-24-gotrue-security-implementation/`
   - Status: Documented but not deployed (0% implementation)
   - Description: Multi-factor authentication system with TOTP, backup codes, admin enforcement
   - Complexity: Medium (2-3 weeks)

2. **Multi-Agent Framework** (High Priority - Infrastructure)
   - Location: `.agent-os/specs/2025-08-24-security-multi-agent/`
   - Status: Completely missing (0% implementation)  
   - Description: Multi-agent security framework representing 40% of security spec scope
   - Complexity: High (3-4 weeks)

[Continue with additional specs...]

Which specification would you like to implement next? Please respond with the number.
```

## Context: Previous Success

2. Used multiple parallel agents simultaneously:
   - Frontend specialist for mobile navigation enhancement
   - Frontend specialist for mobile form optimization  
   - Frontend specialist for touch interactions and gestures
   - General-purpose agent for mobile performance optimization
   - Validation-gates agent for comprehensive testing
   - Documentation-manager for complete documentation
3. Systematic testing and validation
4. Comprehensive documentation creation
5. PR creation and successful merge

**Files Implemented (76 files total):**
- Mobile navigation system (MobileHeader, EnhancedBottomNavigation, MobileDrawer)
- Mobile-optimized forms (11 form components with voice input, camera integration)
- Advanced touch interactions (18 touch components with gestures, haptics)
- Performance optimizations (code splitting, PWA features, service worker)
- Comprehensive test suites (8 test files, 189 scenarios)
- Complete documentation (4 mobile-specific guides)

## Implementation Protocol

Once you select a specification, I will follow this proven systematic approach:

### Phase 1: Preparation & Planning
1. **Branch and Worktree Management**: 
   - Check if current branch is main/master
   - If NOT on main branch: Create worktree in `.worktrees/` folder for isolated development
   - If on main branch: Create feature branch for the selected spec
2. **Specification Analysis**: Deep dive into the spec requirements and current state
3. **Agent Architecture Setup**: Design parallel agent approach for optimal implementation
4. **Task Planning**: Create comprehensive todo list with TodoWrite tool

### Phase 2: Parallel Implementation
1. **Multiple Agent Deployment**: Launch specialized agents simultaneously:
   - Frontend specialists for UI/UX implementation
   - Backend specialists for API/database work
   - Security specialists for security-related specs
   - General-purpose agents for infrastructure tasks
   - Validation-gates agents for testing and quality assurance

2. **Continuous Integration**: Ensure all agents work cohesively with:
   - Real-time development server monitoring
   - Build validation at key milestones
   - Integration testing throughout implementation

### Phase 3: Quality Assurance & Testing
1. **Comprehensive Testing**: Create extensive test suites covering:
   - Unit tests for individual components/functions
   - Integration tests for system interactions
   - Security tests for security-related features
   - Performance tests for optimization requirements
   - User acceptance tests for UX requirements

2. **Validation Gates**: Run all tests and ensure:
   - All specification requirements met
   - No regressions introduced
   - Performance targets achieved
   - Security standards maintained

### Phase 4: Documentation & Deployment
1. **Documentation Creation**: 
   - Technical implementation guides
   - User documentation updates
   - API documentation updates
   - System architecture updates

2. **Pull Request & Merge**:
   - Comprehensive PR with detailed implementation summary
   - Code review and validation
   - **If on main branch**: Successful merge to main branch
   - **If using worktree**: Commit and push to parent branch, then cleanup worktree
   - Post-merge verification

## Worktree Management Protocol

### When NOT on main/master branch:

**Setup Phase:**
1. **Check for .worktrees directory**: Create if it doesn't exist
2. **Update .gitignore**: Add `.worktrees/` to .gitignore if not already present
3. **Create worktree**: `git worktree add .worktrees/spec-[name]-[timestamp] [current-branch]`
4. **Switch to worktree**: Navigate to the worktree directory for isolated development
5. **Create feature branch**: Create feature branch within the worktree for the spec implementation

**Development Phase:**
- All development work happens within the worktree
- Regular commits and pushes to the feature branch within worktree
- Build and test validation within worktree environment

**Completion Phase:**
1. **Final commit and push**: Ensure all changes are committed and pushed from worktree
2. **Return to parent repository**: Navigate back to main repository directory  
3. **Merge changes**: Merge feature branch to parent branch (not main)
4. **Push to parent branch**: Push merged changes to the original non-main branch
5. **Cleanup worktree**: `git worktree remove .worktrees/spec-[name]-[timestamp]`
6. **Verify cleanup**: Confirm worktree directory is removed and parent branch is updated

### When on main/master branch:

**Traditional Flow:**
- Create feature branch directly in main repository
- Develop and test in feature branch
- Create PR and merge to main branch
- No worktree management needed

## Success Criteria

## Command Usage

To use this command:

1. **First, run the pre-step analysis to select a specification**
2. **Then execute**: "Continue implementing the selected specification using the proven multi-agent approach from the Mobile Frontend Rebuild"

The system will then:
- **Branch Detection**: Check if on main/master branch or feature branch
- **Worktree Setup** (if not on main): Create isolated worktree in `.worktrees/` folder
- **Feature Branch Creation**: Create appropriate feature branch (in worktree if applicable)
- **Parallel Agent Architecture**: Set up specialized agents for implementation
- **Systematic Implementation**: Execute specification requirements with comprehensive testing
- **Documentation Creation**: Generate complete technical and user documentation
- **Smart Merge Strategy**: 
  - If on main: Create PR and merge to main branch
  - If using worktree: Merge to parent branch and cleanup worktree
- **Final Validation**: Post-merge verification and cleanup
