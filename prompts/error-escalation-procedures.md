# ERROR ESCALATION PROCEDURES - Dual-Agent System

## OVERVIEW
This document defines comprehensive error escalation procedures for the dual-agent system, including error classification, escalation triggers, recovery strategies, and human intervention protocols.

## ERROR CLASSIFICATION

### Severity Levels

#### CRITICAL (Immediate Escalation)
- **System Security**: Authentication bypass, data exposure, injection vulnerabilities
- **Data Integrity**: Database corruption, data loss, backup failures
- **System Stability**: Memory leaks, infinite loops, system crashes
- **Production Impact**: Service outages, API failures, critical functionality broken

#### HIGH (Escalate after 1 failure)
- **Core Functionality**: Primary features completely broken
- **Integration Failures**: External services inaccessible, API rate limits exceeded
- **Environment Issues**: Missing system dependencies, configuration corruption
- **Resource Exhaustion**: Disk space full, memory limits exceeded

#### MEDIUM (Escalate after 2-3 failures)
- **Feature Implementation**: Complex features partially working
- **Performance Issues**: Significant slowdowns, timeout errors
- **Dependency Conflicts**: Package version incompatibilities
- **Test Failures**: Integration tests failing, complex test scenarios broken

#### LOW (Escalate after 3-5 failures)
- **Code Quality**: Linting errors, formatting issues
- **Documentation**: README updates, comment improvements
- **Non-Critical Features**: Optional functionality, UI polish
- **Minor Bugs**: Edge cases, cosmetic issues

### Error Categories

#### TECHNICAL ERRORS
**Characteristics:** Code-related issues, syntax errors, logic problems
**Common Examples:**
- TypeScript compilation errors
- Runtime exceptions and crashes
- API integration failures
- Database connection issues
- Package installation failures

**Escalation Criteria:**
- Error persists after 3 debugging attempts
- Error indicates fundamental architectural problem
- Error requires domain expertise beyond Worker Agent capability
- Error involves proprietary or undocumented systems

#### CONFIGURATION ERRORS  
**Characteristics:** Environment, build, or deployment configuration issues
**Common Examples:**
- Missing environment variables
- Incorrect file paths or permissions
- Build tool configuration problems
- Database connection string errors
- SSL certificate issues

**Escalation Criteria:**
- Configuration requires system administrator access
- Multiple configuration dependencies are missing
- Configuration conflicts with existing system setup
- Environment setup requires specialized knowledge

#### ARCHITECTURAL ERRORS
**Characteristics:** Design decisions, system integration, scalability issues
**Common Examples:**
- Incompatible design patterns
- Circular dependencies
- Performance bottlenecks
- Data model conflicts
- API design inconsistencies

**Escalation Criteria:**
- Issue requires high-level architectural decisions
- Solution impacts multiple system components
- Problem indicates fundamental design flaw
- Resolution requires stakeholder input

#### RESOURCE ERRORS
**Characteristics:** System resources, external dependencies, access limitations
**Common Examples:**
- API rate limiting
- Insufficient disk space or memory
- Network connectivity issues
- Missing access credentials
- Third-party service outages

**Escalation Criteria:**
- Issue requires administrative or account-level access
- Problem is external and beyond automated control
- Resource limitations cannot be resolved programmatically
- Service provider intervention needed

```

#### Decision Matrix
```

│ HIGH            │ 1 attempt   │ Immediate   │ Immediate   │  
│ MEDIUM          │ 2-3 attempts│ 1-2 attempts│ 1 attempt   │
│ LOW             │ 3-5 attempts│ 2-3 attempts│ 2 attempts  │

### Step 3: Human Intervention Protocol

#### Escalation Delivery
```
Delivery Method: Structured report to human operator
Format: Human-readable summary with technical details
Include: Complete context package and conversation history
Urgency: Appropriate notification level based on severity
```

#### Human Response Options
```
RESOLVE: Human fixes issue and provides resolution
- System resumes with updated context
- Solution documented for future reference
- Learning integrated into agent knowledge

REDIRECT: Human provides alternative approach
- Manager receives new strategic direction  
- Task context updated with constraints/guidance
- Automated processing continues with new parameters

- Human takes ownership of implementation
- System maintains project context for later resumption

ABORT: Task cannot be completed as specified
- Current task marked as incomplete
- Project context preserved for future attempts
- User notified of limitation and alternatives suggested
```
