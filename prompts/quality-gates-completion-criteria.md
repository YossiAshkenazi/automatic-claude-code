# QUALITY GATES & COMPLETION CRITERIA - Dual-Agent System

## OVERVIEW
This document defines comprehensive quality gates and completion criteria for the dual-agent system, ensuring consistent quality standards across all implementation phases and providing clear checkpoints for task progression.

## QUALITY GATE FRAMEWORK

### Gate Structure
```
Quality Gate = Checkpoint + Criteria + Validation + Action
├── Checkpoint: Specific point in development workflow
├── Criteria: Measurable standards that must be met
├── Validation: How compliance is verified
└── Action: What happens when criteria are/aren't met
```

### Gate Enforcement Levels
- **BLOCKING**: Must pass before proceeding (hard stop)
- **WARNING**: Should pass but can continue with documentation (soft stop)
- **INFORMATIONAL**: Provides feedback but doesn't block progress (advisory)

## PRE-IMPLEMENTATION GATES (Manager Agent)

### Gate 1: Instruction Quality Gate (BLOCKING)
**Checkpoint:** Before sending instructions to Worker Agent
**Purpose:** Ensure instructions are clear, complete, and actionable

#### Criteria Checklist
```
Clarity Requirements:
- [ ] Instructions use specific, unambiguous language
- [ ] Technical terms are precise and consistent
- [ ] Actions are clearly stated with active verbs
- [ ] No vague phrases like "improve" or "enhance" without specifics
- [ ] Expected outcomes are explicitly stated

Completeness Requirements:
- [ ] All necessary context provided
- [ ] Dependencies and prerequisites identified
- [ ] Success criteria clearly defined
- [ ] Quality standards specified
- [ ] Validation steps included

Actionability Requirements:
- [ ] Instructions are implementable by Worker Agent
- [ ] Scope is appropriate for single iteration (<30 min work)
- [ ] Required resources are available
- [ ] No external dependencies requiring human intervention
- [ ] Technical approach is within Worker Agent capabilities
```

#### Validation Method
```javascript
function validateInstructions(instructions) {
  const checks = {
    hasSpecificActions: /\b(create|implement|add|fix|update|configure)\s+\w+/.test(instructions),
    hasSuccessCriteria: instructions.includes('test') || instructions.includes('validate') || instructions.includes('verify'),
    hasFileReferences: /\b[\w\/\.-]+\.(js|ts|json|md|py|java|cpp|h)\b/.test(instructions),
    isWithinScope: instructions.length < 2000 && !instructions.includes('and also'),
    avoidsVagueness: !/\b(improve|enhance|optimize|better)\b(?!\s+by|\s+with)/.test(instructions)
  };
  
  return Object.values(checks).every(check => check === true);
}
```

#### Action on Failure
- **BLOCK**: Regenerate instructions with specific improvements
- **LOG**: Record instruction quality issue for pattern analysis
- **LEARN**: Update instruction generation templates

### Gate 2: Scope Validation Gate (BLOCKING)
**Checkpoint:** Before task handoff to Worker Agent
**Purpose:** Ensure task scope is appropriate for automated execution

#### Criteria Checklist
```
Complexity Assessment:
- [ ] Task can be completed in single iteration (max 30 minutes)
- [ ] No complex architectural decisions required
- [ ] Implementation approach is straightforward
- [ ] No deep domain expertise needed beyond general programming
- [ ] Risk level is LOW or MEDIUM (not HIGH or CRITICAL)

Resource Requirements:
- [ ] All required files are accessible
- [ ] Dependencies are already installed or easily installable
- [ ] No external service setup required
- [ ] Development environment is ready
- [ ] No administrative privileges needed

Integration Complexity:
- [ ] Changes are localized to specific components
- [ ] No breaking changes to public APIs
- [ ] Integration points are well-defined and documented
- [ ] No circular dependency risks
- [ ] Backward compatibility maintained
```

#### Validation Method
```
Scope Complexity Matrix:
┌─────────────────┬──────────────┬──────────────┬──────────────┐
│ Factor          │ Simple (1pt) │ Medium (2pt) │ Complex (3pt)│
├─────────────────┼──────────────┼──────────────┼──────────────┤
│ Files Modified  │ 1-2 files    │ 3-5 files    │ 6+ files     │
│ Dependencies    │ None new     │ 1-2 new      │ 3+ new       │
│ Integration     │ Internal only│ 1 external   │ Multiple ext │
│ Testing Needed  │ Unit only    │ Unit + Integ │ Full E2E     │
│ Domain Knowledge│ General prog │ Framework    │ Specialized  │
└─────────────────┴──────────────┴──────────────┴──────────────┘

Score: 5-7 points = Appropriate scope
       8-10 points = Consider breaking down
       11+ points = Must break down or escalate
```

#### Action on Failure
- **BLOCK**: Break task into smaller, manageable pieces
- **REDESIGN**: Simplify approach or defer complex aspects
- **ESCALATE**: If task cannot be simplified, escalate to human

## IMPLEMENTATION GATES (Worker Agent)

### Gate 3: Pre-Commit Validation Gate (BLOCKING)

```

#### Validation Method
```bash
# Automated pre-commit checks
function preCommitValidation() {
  local exitCode=0
  
  # Code quality checks
  npm run lint || exitCode=1
  npm run typecheck || exitCode=1
  
  # Security scanning

  # Test validation
  npm run test:unit || exitCode=1
  
  # Pattern validation
  validateArchitecturePatterns || exitCode=1
  
  return $exitCode
}
```

#### Action on Failure

```

#### Validation Method
```json
{
  "completeness_check": {

      "core_features": "all_implemented",
      "error_handling": "comprehensive",
      "edge_cases": "addressed",
      "performance": "acceptable"
    },
    "testing": {
      "unit_tests": "≥80%_coverage",
      "integration_tests": "key_paths_covered",

    }
  }
}
```

#### Action on Failure

    # Requirements satisfaction (5 points)
    if worker_report.status == "COMPLETED":
        quality_score += 3
    if len(worker_report.accomplished) >= len(worker_report.requirements):
        quality_score += 2
    
    # Code quality indicators (5 points)
    if worker_report.tests.passing_rate >= 0.95:
        quality_score += 2
    if worker_report.tests.coverage >= 0.80:
        quality_score += 2
    if len(worker_report.issues_encountered) == 0:
        quality_score += 1
    
    # Integration health (5 points) 
    if worker_report.validation_performed:
        quality_score += 2
    if "build successful" in worker_report.validation:
        quality_score += 2
    if "no regressions" in worker_report.validation:
        quality_score += 1
    
    return quality_score / max_score
```

#### Action on Assessment
```
Score ≥ 0.85: ACCEPT - Task completed to standard
Score 0.70-0.84: CONDITIONAL - Accept with improvement recommendations
Score 0.50-0.69: CONTINUE - Additional iteration needed
Score < 0.50: ESCALATE - Significant issues require attention
```
