## Technical Analysis

### JSON Parsing Fix Effectiveness

The fix in `claude_code_sdk/core/messages.py` lines 119-133 successfully handles both:

```python
# Before fix: Failed on list responses
if isinstance(data, list):
    # Handle list responses properly
    if len(data) == 1 and isinstance(data[0], dict):
        data = data[0]  # Extract single dict from array
    else:
        # Handle multiple items as stream content
        return CliMessage(type="stream", content=str(data))

# Now handles both dict and list JSON responses correctly
```
