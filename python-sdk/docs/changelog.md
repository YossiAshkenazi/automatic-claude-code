## Release Notes

### Version 0.1.0 Highlights

This is the initial release of the Claude Code SDK, providing a robust and feature-complete Python interface to the Claude Code CLI. Key highlights include:

#### Zero Dependencies
The SDK is built using only Python's standard library, ensuring maximum compatibility and minimal security surface area.

#### Dual-Agent Architecture Ready
While the current version focuses on single-agent operations, the architecture is designed to support the upcoming dual-agent (Manager-Worker) system.

#### Production Ready
- Comprehensive error handling
- Timeout management
- Security best practices
- Extensive testing
- Performance optimization

#### Developer Experience
- Full type annotations
- Rich documentation
- Practical examples
- Clear error messages
- Debug support

### Breaking Changes
None (initial release)

### Migration Guide
Not applicable (initial release)

### Known Issues
- Windows path handling requires forward slashes in some cases
- Large output streams may impact performance on older systems
- Async operations require Python 3.10+ for optimal performance

### Deprecations
None (initial release)

### Security Updates
- Built-in command injection prevention
- Secure subprocess handling
- Input validation and sanitization
- Security scanning integration

## Upcoming Features

### Planned for v0.2.0
- Enhanced dual-agent support with Manager-Worker coordination
- WebSocket integration for real-time communication
- Advanced streaming with backpressure handling
- Plugin system for extensibility
- Enhanced error recovery mechanisms
- Performance metrics and monitoring
- Configuration file support

### Planned for v0.3.0
- GUI integration capabilities
