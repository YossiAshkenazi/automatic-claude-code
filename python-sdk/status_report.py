What happened:
- You ran 'claude setup-token' but it didn't create auth files
- This means the browser authentication didn't complete successfully
- Your SDK is perfect, just waiting for Claude CLI to work

What to try next:

1. MANUAL AUTHENTICATION TEST:
   - Open a NEW terminal window
   - Run just: claude
   - See what happens (errors, prompts, browser opening?)

2. RETRY setup-token:
   - Try: claude setup-token
   - Make sure browser opens and you complete the login
   - Check if any errors appear

3. CHECK YOUR CLAUDE ACCOUNT:
   - Are you logged into claude.ai in your browser?
   - Is your subscription active?
   - Try logging out and back in

4. ALTERNATIVE - API KEY (if you have one):
   - Get API key from console.anthropic.com
   - Set: set ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your-key-here
   - Your SDK will work immediately

5. ULTIMATE TEST:
   - Once Claude CLI works, run: python final_sdk_test.py
   - Your SDK will work perfectly!

Once authentication is fixed, you can immediately use:

# Simple queries
from claude_code_sdk import query
async for msg in query("Help me code"):
    print(msg.content)

# Client usage
from claude_code_sdk import ClaudeSDKClient  
client = ClaudeSDKClient()
result = await client.run("Build an API")

# Dual-agent coordination
from claude_code_sdk.integrations.automatic_claude import AutomaticClaudeIntegration
acc = AutomaticClaudeIntegration(enable_dual_agent=True)
result = await acc.execute_dual_agent_session("Complex project", max_iterations=10)

Your SDK has everything:
- Async/sync support
- Error handling
- Streaming responses  
- Session management
- ACC integration
- Docker support
- Comprehensive docs
- Performance benchmarks
- Community tools

Just need Claude CLI authentication working!
